BY JAMES HAIRBY, M.D.</p>

<p class="in0">Normandy, the cradle of our monarchy and aristocracy, the last
resting-place of our early kings, and the scene of our first great
struggles against France, must ever have strong interest for Englishmen.
We find our national associations connected with its most
striking localities; and many of our leading families must refer to
the archives of this province for the antiquities of their race. It is
also as rich in natural scenery as it is in historical associations; its
peasants surpass those of the rest of France in industry, intelligence,
and comforts; while the numerous English families who annually
visit its sea-coast for the purpose of bathing have brought it almost
as close to England in alliance as it was anciently in connection.</p>

<p class="in0">This Volume will record the impressions of a two years' residence,
and sundry journeyings in the province, furnishing a useful guide
to visitors, and information for tarry-at-home travellers. The Illustrations
will consist of a variety of subjects, Costume, Landscape,
and Architecture.</p>

<p>With the exception of the last three sketches, the
pieces composing these two volumes were written
during the author's confinement, for "conspiracy,"
in Stafford gaol, merely, as a relief from the intenser
thought exercised in the composition of his
"Prison-Rhyme,"&mdash;"The Purgatory of Suicides,"&mdash;already
published. Higher merit than naturalness
combined with truth is not claimed for any of the
stories: they are, simply, such as any man may
write who has the least power of pourtraying the
images which human life, in some of its humblest,
least disguised forms, has impressed on his memory,&mdash;while
the heart has formed no attachment sufficiently
powerful to seduce the judgment into a
decision, that it is either wise or honest to hide these
images from the observance of others. Nearly all
the homely characters sketched are real,&mdash;some of
them, in their very names; and the few adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
allotted to them, are devoid of romance and intricacy,
because they seldom exceed fact.</p>

<p>The "<i>Old</i> Lincolnshire," so often mentioned in
these simple pieces, and endeared to the writer of
them by the associations of thirty years of his life,
is likely soon to disappear before the social changes
of that <i>New</i> Lincolnshire which railway "civilisation"
will summon into existence:&mdash;would that the
manufacturing-misery of the modern Leicestershire,
outlined in two or three uncoloured and painfully-veritable
pictures, might, as speedily, evanish!</p>

<p>Of the three concluding sketches, the writer feels
it right to state that the first is merely a slight
alteration of a series of paragraphs furnished to the
<i>Stamford Mercury</i>, in 1838, and records strict facts
which were then occurring in Lincolnshire; while
the two remaining fragments were intended to form
parts of a novel, in some degree autobiographical,&mdash;but
the completion of which was relinquished, at
first, from a toilful engagement with the sterner
business of life, and at length from a growing preference
for other subjects.</p>

<h2>KUCKY SARSON, THE BARBER;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
THE DISCIPLE OF EQUALITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;and that was when "French
principles," as they were called, were beginning to
spread in England, and here and there one began to
profess admiration of the new republic,&mdash;there lived
in the little town of Caistor, in North Lincolnshire,
a notable barber of the name of Habakkuk Sarson,&mdash;but
"Kucky" was the name by which he was familiarly
known; for Lincolnshire folk are a plain folk,
and don't like, nor ever did, to trouble themselves
with uttering long cramp names.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say how it was exactly,
but somehow or other, in spite of the alarm which
landowners and tenantry alike felt at the broaching
of Jacobinism,"&mdash;that <i>terror terrorum</i> to the squirearchy
and farmers,&mdash;Kucky Sarson contrived to keep
a fair share of custom in the matter of clipping hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and scraping beards. Scarcely an hour of the day
but Kucky had a customer; or if customers scanted, he
was sure to have company for gossip. Perhaps it
was chiefly owing to the frank-heartedness and real
courtesy of manner which the barber mingled with
his earnest speech&mdash;for he was a very great talker,
and a good one too,&mdash;that he was respected by almost
all who knew him, notwithstanding his open profession
of the principles of "equality."</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a maxim of Kucky Sarson, that, "if
you believed all men to be equal, you ought to treat
every man like a gentleman." "That is the especial
hinderance to the spread of first principles, sir," said
Kucky to a customer one day. "Democrats foolishly
imagine, sir, that democracy consists in barking like a
bull-dog, or growling like a bear, at every man they
meet; when, the fact is, that that is just the way to
repel a sensible man from both yourself and your
principles. Don't you think so, sir?"</p>

<p>Kucky's customer would have answered, but Kucky
held him at that moment by the nose, and was applying
a keen razor to his upper lip. The earnest
shaver did not think of this, but supposed, since his
customer was a stranger, that he was either modest
or unacquainted with politics; and, in the latter case,
Kucky was too true an enthusiast to omit the opportunity
of trying to make a convert&mdash;so he resumed,
after clearing his throat with a loud "a-hem!"</p>

<p>"If the beautiful principles of equality do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
spread, sir," he said, resolving to show his best graces
of conversational style to a well-dressed stranger, "in
my humble opinion, it will be chiefly attributable to
the miscalculating rudeness of those who affect to
advocate them. These principles, in themselves, are
so self-evidently true, and so happily calculated to
ensure the felicity of the human family, that it is impossible
for any unprejudiced man to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, friend," said the stranger, extricating
his nose from the barber's fingers somewhat dexterously,
"there may be considerable doubt about the
self-evident truth of the principles you are speaking
of: you seem to me to be somewhat too hasty in
concluding that every one, from even a candid review
of them, must acknowledge them to be incontrovertible.
Give me leave to say, my good friend, that
nothing will be more stoutly controverted than these
same doctrines of human equality."</p>

<p>"Men may controvert them, sir," rejoined the
barber, with some shade of an approach to asperity of
manner, "but I cannot, in my conscience, give them
credit for sincerity. Who was ever born into the
world with a star on his breast or his shoulder, to
signify that he ought to rule his fellows solely by his
own will?&mdash;or who was ever created with a crook on
his knee, to signify that he ought to bow down to the
caprice of others? No, sir, the doctrines of equality
are as clear as daylight when opposed to the darkness
of slavery and mastership. In short, sir, 'Right is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
every man's, but wrong is no man's right,' was a
maxim of my grandfather,&mdash;and I think it settles the
question."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the stranger, staring at the
barber's last words, and opening his lips till the lather
ran into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I think so," repeated Kucky, striving
to look as confident as before, but evidently somewhat
doubtful, on second thought, of the conclusiveness of
his own odd logic,&mdash;"I think so, sir; for, as I hold
it to be a natural right for every man to be governed
only by his own consent, so I conclude it to be
wrong for any other man to attempt to rule him
without first asking his will or waiting his choice.
I think those two points are as clear as twice two
makes four: the first is a right, and belongs to every
man, and the second is a wrong that should be
practised by no man. Does not my grandfather's
precept mean the same thing&mdash;'Right is every
man's, but wrong is no man's right?'"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my friend," replied the gentleman,
unable entirely to suppress a smile, "if I say that I
admire your sincerity more than your logic. Allow
me further to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, allow, sir!" exclaimed the barber, bowing
very low, and spreading out his hands,&mdash;"to be sure,
I allow every man to judge for himself, sir. It would
be extremely inconsistent in me, who claim the fullest
freedom of opinion myself, to refuse others the liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of thought, sir. I pray you, sir, forgive me if I have
been a little too positive in my manner: I will assure
you, sir, I am not a bigot,&mdash;indeed, I am not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, stay, my friend!" cried the stranger, puzzled
and bothered with the superlative politeness of
him of the razor, "if you will finish your operation
upon my chin, we will have half-an-hour's talk on
these subjects afterwards. In the mean time, believe
me, I am happy to find you are so truly tolerant of
other men's opinions: if we all cultivated that spirit,
this world would speedily be much happier than
it is."</p>

<p>"Excellent&mdash;excellent, sir!" exclaimed the honest
and enthusiastic barber, resuming his shaving, but
too much excited to leave his favourite theme&mdash;"you
speak like a true gentleman, sir. I see we really
agree, although we may seem to differ; for you have
just maintained a sentiment which is purely in accordance
with the principles I profess. Some great man
once said, 'No man was ever born with a saddle
on his back, nor was any other man brought into the
world ready booted and spurred to ride him.' That
was a very true and striking saying: do you recollect
it, sir?"</p>

<p>"I recollect it, and admire it much," answered the
gentleman; "but I do not just now remember whose
it is."</p>

<p>"Nor I, sir," rejoined the garrulous barber; "but
that is of little consequence, sir: truths are valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
solely for their own weight, and not for the sake of
those who utter them."</p>

<p>"There, again, we differ," observed the stranger.
"I think that many truths are doubly valuable;&mdash;first,
for their intrinsic excellence, and often, secondarily,
for the sake of the great and the good men who
utter them. For instance, the striking saying you
have just quoted becomes, to my mind, as a passionate
lover of his own country, increasedly valuable,
when I remember that it is attributed to the illustrious
patriot-martyr, Algernon Sydney."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," resumed Kucky Sarson, who was the
soul of ingenuity at an argument, "the man, and the
truth he utters, are very often one, essentially. Some
men's lives&mdash;nay, their very deaths,&mdash;are great truths
in themselves,&mdash;like the life and death of the noble
commonwealthsman you have just mentioned: in
such cases the man becomes so closely and entirely
identified with the truths he utters, that he and they
may be said to be one."</p>

<p>"You are now really becoming too refined for me,
my friend," replied the gentleman, laughing. "But
give me the pleasure of your company for a couple of
hours at my inn, if you please, and I will do my best
to discuss these points with you, good-humouredly
and charitably, over a glass of wine."</p>

<p>The barber was making his politest acknowledgments,
and was assuring the gentleman that he felt
highly honoured and gratified by his handsome invitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
when old Farmer Garbutt, a regular customer
of Kucky's for more than thirty years past, although
a stout "church-and-king" man, pushed his burly
person in at the little shop door, and gruffly bidding
the barber "good-morning," sat down in the shaving-chair,
which the gentleman had just quitted. Farmer
Garbutt could not have come at a moment when he
was less welcome; but Bucky Sarson could not decline
to shave a beard he had shorn for so long a
period, and therefore politely assured the strange
gentleman that he would be with him, at his inn, in
the course of a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Ere the farmer's beard was cleansed, however,
more than one additional chin had gathered round
the chair; and what was most vexing to Kucky, in
his impatient mood, was the "striking fact" that all
the chins and their beards belonged to the most
extreme and sturdy opposers of Kucky's republican
principles to be found among his regular customers.
With all his acquirement of <i>suave</i> manners, the poor
barber was greatly in danger of going into a passion,
as he heard, first one, and then another, allude, jeeringly,
to the persecution that was commencing against
Kucky's favourite doctrines. Yet he kept down the
rising storm within, though with a considerable
struggle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;they'll soon hang all the levellers
out o' the way, I'll warrant 'em!" said gruff Garbutt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
rolling his eye in wicked waggery at his neighbours,
and then threateningly at Kucky.</p>

<p>"What else can folk expect that side with cutting
off kings' heads?" cried Bobby Sparrow, a dapper
little master-tailor, who made and repaired habits for
the parson, and all the genteel people, of Caistor
and its vicinity.</p>

<p>"More by token&mdash;such folk as would pull down
all the parish churches, and murder all the Protestants!"
added old Davy Gregson, a fat little retired
man of business, who liked to enjoy his joke,&mdash;sitting
in a corner of the old shop, and thrusting his tongue
grotesquely into his cheek,&mdash;although he was nearly
fourscore.</p>

<p>"You will please to remember, gentlemen," interjected
the barber, driven to the extremity of his
temper, "that <i>I</i> am <i>not</i> an advocate either for cutting
off kings' heads, or pulling down parish churches, or
murdering people of any religion, much more my
own."</p>

<p>"But ye take part with rogues that do, neighbour
Kucky," said Bobby Sparrow, with provoking pertness,&mdash;"and
the more's the shame to you!"</p>

<p>"Ay, marry, good faith&mdash;that he does!" exclaimed
old Davy Gregson, enjoying the barber's
apparent soreness; "and it has always been held
that the abettor is as bad as the thief or the murderer!"</p>

<p>"If you mean to be respected, Kucky Sarson,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
growled old farmer Garbutt, "be advised, and give
up all your Jacobin notions. The Squire says it
would be ruin for this country to be without a king
and an established church. I had a famous talk with
him on all these things at the rent-day; and so he
said: and if such gentlefolk as Squire Pelham don't
know what belongs to good government, I should
like to know who does."</p>

<p>"Squire Pelham's great-grandfather was of a
somewhat different opinion," answered the barber:
"Peregrine Pelham was his name; and he signed the
death-warrant of Charles Stuart."</p>

<p>"The Lord be merciful to us!" exclaimed old
Davy, beginning to look really alarmed&mdash;"why,
that was in the time of the awful troubles that my
grandmother used to talk so sorrowfully about!&mdash;Surely
you don't wish that such grievous days were
come again, do you, Kucky Sarson?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" ejaculated farmer Garbutt, solemnly.</p>

<p>"You all <i>know</i> I don't, before you ask me," answered
the barber, with some show of dignity. "I
defy any one of you to say that there is a quieter
and more upright citizen in England than I am.
Who can say that I ever injured him? who dares
say that I ever cheated any man of one farthing&mdash;ay,
or that I owe him one? And do I ever try to
compel any man to think as I think? Speak!&mdash;any
one of you that can charge me with an act of
wrongfulness, or a single speech of intolerance!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;excuse us, Kucky! We all regard
you as an excellent neighbour. But you seem
more short about taking a joke than usual," answered
the dapper little master-tailor.</p>

<p>The barber merely bowed, and said, "Well, well&mdash;never
mind, never mind, neighbours! we are none
the worse friends for a joke." But he was conscious
that he felt short-tempered, and heartily
wished his customers would shorten their stay, in
order that he might visit the gentleman at his inn.
Agreeably to his wish, the farmer, the master-tailor,
and the retired man of business each shook hands
heartily with Kucky, after a few more sentences of
restorative kindness, and bid him "good-day." The
barber forthwith doffed his apron and fore-pocket,
adjusted his neckerchief, brushed his hat, exchanged
his shop jacket for his holiday-coat, and crying
"Shop, my dear!" to his wife, hurried away towards
the inn, where, according to the strange gentleman's
request, Kucky had promised to meet him.</p>

<p>To the barber's great mortification, when he
arrived at the inn the gentleman had been called out,
and had left word that he would be happy to receive
his new acquaintance at six in the evening. Kucky
Sarson felt half disposed to be unhappy with disappointment;
for he feared that he would be unable to
leave his shop at that busy hour of the evening. He
was hastening homeward, and striving to banish this
unpleasant feeling, when, passing by the end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
narrow street or lane, he suddenly saw the strange
gentleman in close conversation with a ragged, dirty-looking
female, who seemed by her uncouth garb and
sun-burnt complexion to belong to the wandering
race of the gypsies. The barber stopped short and
gazed in astonishment at what he saw. The woman
bent her keen eyes upon him; but the strange gentleman
seemed too much absorbed in looking at and
talking to the gypsy to be aware that he was discovered.</p>

<p>The barber passed on to his shop, pondering much
upon what he had observed.&mdash;"What in the name
of prudence and propriety!" soliloquised Kucky,
"can such a person have to do with a houseless out-cast
and vagabond of a gypsy?" The more he
thought upon it, the more he wondered; till, in the
course of an hour, seeing that no one stepped into
the shop, he felt so exquisitely curious to know the
meaning of what he had seen, that he once more
doffed his apron and shop-coat, put on his holiday
covering, and sallied forth again in search of the
strange gentleman's secret.</p>

<p>Turning the first corner of the street, he suddenly
ran hard against his old gossip, Davy Gregson, and
nearly knocked him down in his haste.</p>

<p>"Hey-day, Kucky!" exclaimed Davy, "what a
hurry you are in!&mdash;I reckon you are posting away
to see the gentleman dance with the gypsy!"</p>

<p>Davy Gregson's exclamation operated like lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
upon the barber: he took to his heels and ran,
in the direction from whence Davy came, with all the
mettle he possessed. Just as he was crossing the
way, however, at the end of one street with the intent
to run down another, he was suddenly seized by
little Bobby Sparrow, the dapper master-tailor.</p>

<p>"What the dickens are you running so for,
Kucky?" asked the little man; "you'll be too late
to see the gentleman huddle the gypsy&mdash;it's all
over, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huddle the gypsy!" exclaimed Kucky, "I
thought he was dancing with her?"</p>

<p>"So he was: but he fell to kissing and huddling
her after that," answered Sparrow.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake let me go see," cried the barber;
and bolted away again at the hazard of tearing
his coat, which the tailor had kept hold of. But
before he had stretched one hundred yards, he was
once more stopped; and this time it was by the
strong and effectual gripe of gruff farmer Garbutt.</p>

<p>"Art thou mad, Kucky Sarson?" asked the
farmer, "or what is the reason that thou art scampering
away at such a hare-brained rate?"</p>

<p>"The gypsy!" gasped the barber, still striving to
run,&mdash;"the gypsy and the gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, man!&mdash;the gentleman has suddenly
found his sister who was stolen when she was young,"
said the farmer: "the gentleman has explained it all
himself, and has taken the young woman into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Pelham's Arms, where he puts up. I thought thou
hadst had more sense, Kucky, than to run after any
crowd that gathered in the street."</p>

<p>"Crowd!" echoed the barber, "was there a crowd
then?</p>

<p>"A crowd!" repeated the farmer, "that was
there, I assure thee. There: good-bye, Kucky!"
and so saying he loosed hold of his neighbour, who
was now in some degree cooled down.</p>

<p>Kucky Sarson did not set off to run again; but
walked musingly on towards the Pelham's Arms
Inn, resolved, if possible, to get at the bottom of the
curious incidents just related. He was shown into
the strange gentleman's room at once, when he had
intimated that it would be inconvenient for him to
call at six in the evening. And now the barber felt
completely embarrassed, and quite ashamed of his
own curiosity, in having forced himself upon the
stranger so suddenly after the affecting occurrence
he had just been informed of by old farmer Garbutt.
In fact, Kucky had begun to stammer forth very odd
apologies, and was backing out of the room with a
profusion of bows and scrapes, when the gentleman
rose, and leading his newly-recovered relative by the
hand, introduced her to his humble visitor. Kucky
Sarson recognised her face for the same he had seen
in the narrow street a short time before; but the
altered dress and demeanour of the female caused him
to take her hand with much greater reverence than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
he would have shown had that hand been offered him
when he first saw its owner.</p>

<p>"I saw you a short time ago, when my brother
had just discovered me," observed the female, as the
barber took her hand.</p>

<p>"You did, madam," replied he, stammering with
confusion, and surprised at the peculiar grace wherewith,
he now thought, the gypsy conducted herself.</p>

<p>"No doubt you felt greatly surprised when you
saw us," observed the gentleman.</p>

<p>"I must say I did," answered the barber, still
looking very bashful.</p>

<p>"Did you witness any of my capers in the street,
my friend? I am fearful that I have played a somewhat
foolish part, for my elation well nigh drove me
out of my senses. Come, my good friend," concluded
the gentleman, noting the shy look of the barber,
"let us sit down, and, over a comfortable glass of
wine, talk over this matter;&mdash;not forgetting your
family adage of 'Right is every man's, but Wrong is
no man's right.'"</p>

<p>They were seated accordingly; and the barber,
having been plied with a couple of glasses of claret,
and his shame-facedness having vanished, the gentleman
renewed the conversation, with a look of great
good-humour.</p>

<p>"My good friend," said he, "I remember an observation
of yours which, it strikes me, you cannot
always bring to bear upon your mind with the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of a maxim, although you profess to have made it
one: it was that 'When we believe all men to be
equal, we ought to treat every man like a gentleman.'
Now, tell me, frankly, did you not completely forget
your principles of equality at the moment you saw
me with this my beloved and only sister, in the guise
of a vagabond gypsy?" The gentleman took the
hand of his recovered relative once more in his own,
and they looked with joy and love upon each other.</p>

<p>The barber felt conscience-stricken with the inconsistency
between his philosophy and his practice, in
this notable instance, and, despite his natural loquacity,
remained dumb.</p>

<p>"Nay, my good friend," resumed the stranger;
"do not think yourself unlike other people. Let me
see you rally, and display the spirit you did this
morning: all the world is too prone to fail in the act
of applying principles and professions to practice."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed, feel," said the barber at length, but
still hanging down his head, "that I have <i>not</i> felt and
acted as a disciple of the great doctrine of equality
ought to have felt and acted this day."</p>

<p>"And I think you will not fail to draw this great
lesson from your own experience, my friend," rejoined
the gentleman, "that, however intrinsically true it
may be that we are all equal in the eye of Him who
made us, yet our birth, our early associations, our
habits,&mdash;in brief, the whole complexity of circumstances
with which we are every hour, nay, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
moment, surrounded, renders it absolutely impossible
for any of us to act at all times, or even generally,
upon the conviction of that most undeniable and
solemn truth."</p>

<p>"You are perfectly right, sir," replied the barber,
conscious that the stranger spoke the language of
common sense, and feeling humbled into willing discipleship.</p>

<p>"And, granting the doctrine of equality to be
strictly true," continued the gentleman, "yet how
long, how very long must it be, ere the race of mankind
shall be able to throw off their prejudices&mdash;their
present artificial condition, shall we call it?&mdash;so
completely as to reinduce and reinstate that universal
equality we have just agreed to be natural."</p>

<p>"Very sensible, sir," interjected Kucky Sarson;
"but I am just thinking," he added, feeling some return
of his usual confidence, "that equality never
will be reinstated, unless we spread its great doctrines
by all the means in our power. Equality must be
enuntiated, maintained, and defended, sir; or, like
other truths which have lain hid for ages, it will not
produce any fruit."</p>

<p>"True, my good friend," answered the gentleman;
"but permit me to remind you that practice is more
powerful than precept. If we each sought to act
towards our fellow-creatures as if they were really
our brethren and sisters, the principles of a true
equality would soon gain a citadel in each human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
heart. It is the putting into practice of this deep
conviction of our common brotherhood which is really
most worthy of our endeavours. We may contend
against the artificial distinctions which are established
among men till doomsday; but if we do not, on all
occasions, display brotherly feeling towards our fellows,
our contention will produce no salutary effect."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," said the barber, "I feel you are by
far the more consistent philosopher of the two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the gentleman, cutting short the barber's
strain of intended panegyric; "I would not
have you suppose that I am a perfect practiser of the
maxims I am recommending. I never yet found a
man who fulfilled his own definition of a philanthropist,
a patriot, or a philosopher,&mdash;that is, if his definition
were worthy of being termed one. I only
press this fact upon your notice, my friend: that I
was once in the habit of talking as loudly about
equality as yourself,&mdash;nay, even dogmatically about
it, and that is <i>not</i> like your way of talking; but I
have ceased to talk about the name, and am now endeavouring
to spread the spirit of it. I try to do all
the good I can, to make every one as happy as I can,
to banish all the misery I can. I cannot always
keep in mind that every human being I meet is my
brother or sister; for the force of old habit is such
that a pernicious aristocracy moves within me sometimes,
but I try to keep it down. My friend, I am
preaching <i>to</i> you, rather than conversing <i>with</i> you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
but we will now leave this subject for some lighter
theme, if you please; only permit me to say, in conclusion,
that you must never believe yourself to be a
thorough disciple of Equality while a grain of offence
arises in your mind on seeing a gentleman converse
with a gypsy."</p>

<p>It would be tiresome to pursue any further the
conversation of the barber and the strange gentleman.
Suffice it to say that Kucky Sarson was an altered
man from that day, though he never saw the gentleman
again. He subdued the habit of expressing his
convictions in terms which he knew must give offence
and create prejudice, rather than advance truth, couch
them as courteously as he might in the flourish of
politeness. He turned his efforts, in the humble
sphere of his conventional existence, rather towards
preparing the world for rigid truth, than towards impelling
the people into the acknowledgment and practice
of principles of which they had not as yet learned
the alphabet. These changes, to Kucky Sarson's
honour be it spoken, came over his spirit, not through
cowardice,&mdash;for he possessed enough of strength of
mind and principle to have braved a prison, had he
thought his lot cast in the fitting and becoming time:
it was honest conviction which acted as a mollifier of
Kucky's manners, and the usefulness of the change
in him was evidenced by the greater good he effected
in his modified character. He preserved his grandfather's
favourite saying to the last day of his life;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and, as no one sought more ardently to fulfil the character
of an humble philanthropist,&mdash;to alleviate distress
wherever he found it,&mdash;to soften and dissipate
asperity of temper, and to create the genuine feeling
of brotherhood, and the practice of self-sacrifice
among all men,&mdash;so his name and favourite adage
were remembered after his death; insomuch that
when a word tending to difference arose among the
plain inhabitants of Caistor-in-Lindsey, it was usually
succeeded, and the difference prevented, by some one
observing, "Why, neighbours, what's the use of
wrangling? You know what good Kucky Sarson
used to say,&mdash;'Right is every man's, and Wrong is
no man's right.'"</p>

<h2>RAVEN DICK, THE POACHER;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"WHO SCRATCHED THE BULL?"</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Kiah Dobson,&mdash;they always called him Kiah "for
shortness sake," as we used to say in Lincolnshire;
but his full name was Hezekiah,&mdash;Kiah Dobson
was a hearty buck of a farmer, who ploughed about
fifty acres, and fed sheep and bullocks on about fifty
others. He was a tenant of good old Squire Anderson,
the ancestor of the Yarboroughs, who are called
Lords in these new-fashioned times. Lindsey and
its largest landlord presented, it need scarcely be
said, very different features sixty years ago to those
they present now. Squire Anderson kept a coach,
but he had not three or four, like his successor, the
peer: he had one good house at Manby, but he had
not that and a much grander one at Brocklesby, another
at Appuldercome, in the Isle of Wight, and
another in town.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The farmers of Lindsey kept each a good nag, for
market service, and so forth; but it was a very, very
scarce thing to find a blood horse in their stables;
and when their dames went to market, it was on the
pillion-seat, behind the farmer himself, and not in
the modern kickshaw gig. There were none of your
strongholds of starvation, which the famishing thousands
call "Bastiles," in those days; and a horn of
good humming ale, and a motherly slice of bread and
cheese, awaited the acceptance of any poor man who
happened to be journeying, and called either at the
hall of the squire or at the cottages of any of the
farmers on his extensive estates.</p>

<p>Kiah Dobson was nearing his cottage one November
evening, a little before dusk, when a figure caught
his eye, the sight of which roused his gall,&mdash;and yet
Kiah was by no means a choleric or hasty-tempered
man. It was Raven Dick, the poacher, that the
farmer was so wroth to see; for Dick was beheld
as the farmer had beheld him nearly fifty times before,&mdash;with
a bundle of dead hares under his arm. The
farmer turned to cross the home-close in another direction,
willing, as it seemed, to give Dick another
fair opportunity of getting safely away. But "the
devil was in Dick for impudence," as Kiah used often
to say,&mdash;"if you gave him an inch, he would be
sure to take an ell!" Not content with imposing on
farmer Dobson's good-nature forty-nine times in the
course of his harum-scarum life, he must e'en "try it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
on" for the fiftieth, and so made the experiment just
once too often.</p>

<p>"Farmer! how d'ye feel yoursen?" said Dick,
striding up to Kiah Dobson, and looking him full in
the face, as bold as a bull-dog.</p>

<p>"Better than thou'lt feel, scapegrace! when thou
gets thy hempen collar on!" replied the farmer,
snarling as angrily as a mastiff when he doesn't like
you.</p>

<p>"May be the thread of it isn't spun yet," retorted
Dick, mocking the farmer's angry tone.</p>

<p>"Surely, old Nick himself isn't more impudent
than his children that wear his own colour!" exclaimed
Kiah, darting a withering look at Dick's black face,
for Dick's skin was even swarthier than a gypsy's;
and I might as well say now as at any other time,
that the sable shade of Dick's countenance, coupled
with their knowledge of his wild way of life, were
the emphatic reasons why his neighbours gave him
the epithet of "Raven."</p>

<p>Now, above all things, Dick did not like these
reflections on his unfair colour; so, with something
in the shape of an oath, Dick turned his heel in
dudgeon, and seemed, not at all to the farmer's displeasure,
to be bent on making his way home.</p>

<p>Dame Dobson, who was a stout country-wife, and
was labouring lustily at her churn, and scolding one
of her maids, who had been idling, just as her husband
entered the cottage, caught a sight of the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
poacher with the hares under his arm ere the
farmer could close the door, and, with the anger that
her maid had kindled, was ill prepared to brook new
provocation.</p>

<p>"Shame on thee, Kiah, for letting that rascal
escape so often!" she exclaimed, screaming so loudly
that Dick could hear her words distinctly, though
nearly half way over the close; "it will come to the
Squire's ears at long-last, thou may depend on't!
and then thou knowst what will follow!"</p>

<p>"Hang the villain!" said Kiah, "he really deserves
nabbing; and I've half a mind to go after him and
collar him; for, confound him! he grows more brazenly
impudent than a miller's horse! he's getting
worse than come-out!"</p>

<p>"You'll ha' no need to do that," said the incorrigibly
idle maiden, who had gone to the window to
peep at the poacher, in spite of her mistress's fierce
scolding, "he's turned again, and has been listening
to you, and now he's coming hither as fast as shanks'
horse can carry him!"</p>

<p>And so it was, for Dick had changed his intent;
and, with a perverse will, now strode, at full stretch,
towards the door of the farm house.</p>

<p>"Curse his gallows-neck!" exclaimed farmer Dobson,
between his teeth, when he heard the maiden's
words: "has he such a brass-face as that comes to?
I'll nab him this time, or I'm a Dutchman else!"</p>

<p>Raven Dick's foot was on the grunsel almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
before the farmer had finished this last sentence; and
throwing himself on a chair in the kitchen, and the
hares on the cottage floor, alike with the air and impudence
of one who braves the gallows, he asked for a
horn of ale and a lump of bread and cheese with as
little ceremony as if he had been a squire in his own
mansion. Dick's audacity, however, had now overstretched
its mark. The farmer's strong fist was on
Dick's frock collar in a moment; the next, the farmer
had dragged him from his seat; and, in the third,
Dick was prostrate on the cottage floor. Unluckily,
Kiah Dobson's anger overbalanced his caution; and,
with the impetuosity of his own force upon the poacher,
Kiah brought himself, also, to the floor.</p>

<p>Dick had so long careered it over the farmer's fields,
by day and by night, and had so often "snickled,"
or noosed the hares, as one may say, under the
farmer's nose, and the farmer had all the while
taken it so mildly, that the poacher was never more
surprised in his life than at this portentous assault
upon his person by mild, good-natured Kiah Dobson.
Had it not been for his imaginary security of feeling,
the poacher would not so easily have been overthrown.
And, as it was, Dick was not disposed to believe that
all was over with him; he speedily succeeded in
wriggling his body from under the farmer's weight,
and, in the course of a few minutes, had his knee
upon Kiah's breast, and began to grab the farmer so
tightly by the throat that he soon grew blacker than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Dick himself. Luckily Dame Dobson's churn staff
came to the rescue. She pommelled the hard head
of the poacher so soundly, and her strokes came so
thick and fast after each other, that he was compelled
to loose his hold on the farmer's throat, in order to
catch the churn-staff from the farmer's wife. The
engagement, however, now became more furious.
Poor Kiah lay gasping on the floor, for some moments,
unable to rise, much less to aim a blow at the adversary;
but the war was at its height between
Raven Dick and the dame, and two stout maidens of
her service. Mops, brooms, and brushes were successively
impelled with no playful force towards the
seasoned skull of the poacher, but were shivered with
the rapidity of lightning, as he dexterously caught
hold of them, and wrested them from the hands of his
clamorous assailants. The din of female tongues
was scarcely less than the noise of blows; and when
the more effective ammunition was all expended, the
discharge was confined, at last, to the small shot of
epithets, poured in every imaginable shape, from
the fair musketry of the three female belligerents'
mouths.</p>

<p>The scene had now become as laughable as previously
it had been serious. Raven Dick stood on a
chair in the middle of the floor, drawing his face into
the most whimsical forms and mocking the women,
while they stood around him, each with hands on hip,
and tearing their throats with the effort to abuse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
irritate, or otherwise to shame him. The farmer,
seeing what turn the war had taken, had seated himself
on a chair, and forgetting his anger, was shaking
his sides with laughter at the ludicrous and unwonted
scene presented that night in his kitchen. The affray
at length shrank into silence; the women's tongues
were fairly wearied; they each sat down to rest; and
so Dick sat down, likewise.</p>

<p>"Dang it Dick, thou'rt a good woolled 'un!" said
the hearty farmer; "but thou art an idle rogue, after
all."</p>

<p>"How so, Maister Kiah?" asked the saucy
poacher; "why do you call me an idle rogue?"</p>

<p>"Because thou art fonder of stealing than working,"
quickly replied the farmer.</p>

<p>"Stealing, say you?" rejoined Dick, his brows
knitting together; "I scorn your words, Kiah
Dobson!&mdash;You lie in your throat!&mdash;What do I
steal?"</p>

<p>"The 'squire's hares, by dozens, thou saucy
varlet," answered Kiah.</p>

<p>"How come they to be the 'squire's hares?"
asked Dick, fixing his eyes very keenly on the
farmer.</p>

<p>"By feeding and breeding on his land," answered
Kiah Dobson.</p>

<p>"But don't <i>you</i> plough the land, Farmer Dobson?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"And don't <i>you</i> buy the seed to sow upon the
land?"</p>

<p>"Sartainly I do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And don't <i>you</i> sow the seed when you have
bought it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and I can sow a breadth with here and
there a fellow in any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!&mdash;don't <i>you</i> watch the corn while it is
growing, weed it, and attend to it till it is ripe? and
do not <i>you</i>, with the sweat of your own brow, and the
help of those you hire with your own purse, reap the
corn, and gather it into the stack-yard?&mdash;and don't
<i>you</i>, afterwards, pay many a shilling in wages for
Roger Brown, and Tim Wilson, and others, to thrash
your corn for you?&mdash;and don't you consider the corn
<i>yours</i> when you are taking it to market?&mdash;and don't
you think <i>you</i> have a right to receive the money for
which you sell it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and I would fain be knowing, Dick, who
besides has so good a right to it as I have," replied
the farmer, starting to his feet with warmth, and not
apprehending the drift of Dick's queries.</p>

<p>"Then the corn which these poor hares have eaten
during the summer," said Dick, pointing to the dead
animals which lay on the floor, "was <i>your</i> corn, and
<i>not</i> the 'squire's, for you pay him his rent, don't
you, Kiah?"</p>

<p>"Zounds, ay! to the very day," instantly and
proudly replied the farmer.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet <i>you</i> durst not kill a hare, and be seen
in doing it," said Dick, not permitting a moment's
pause to take place.</p>

<p>"Me kill a hare!" exclaimed Kiah, scratching his
head, and colouring very deeply; "Lord! you know,
Dick, I've no licence; and, besides, the 'squire
always reckons the hares his own, you know."</p>

<p>"Does he?" said Dick, with a peculiar sneer,
"then he's a fool for so doing.&mdash;Why, Farmer
Dobson, don't you remember how, last latter-end,
three persons came from Lincoln, and went shooting
like wild devils over the whole estate, murdering and
bagging all they could see? And it's more than
likely you'll have a greater number of the Lincoln
Minster Jackdaws, as the 'squire called 'em, this
month than you had last November; and will the
'squire be such a fool as to call the hares his own
then, when the black thieves are packing off with
them, think you?"</p>

<p>"Dang it! thou talks very odd, Dick!" said the
farmer, sitting down very quietly, fixing his eyes on
the floor, and scratching his head harder than before;
"thou talks very odd, but what thou say'st is as true
as the gospel, for all that."</p>

<p>"That it is, as sure as eggs are eggs," added the
dame, into whose mind conviction had been entering
a little more quickly than into that of her husband.</p>

<p>"There now!" exclaimed Dick, springing from his
seat, and feeling proud of the power of his argumentation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
when he saw both the farmer and his wife
brought over so triumphantly to his side of the
question. "There now, you see, Kiah Dobson, a
man may be judged very wrongly, and be condemned
for a thief and a rogue by many who are either&mdash;saving
your presence, farmer&mdash;thorough fools
or rogues themselves, and yet, all the while, he may
be quite as honest as his neighbours. Now, don't
you think it hard, Kiah, under all the circumstances,
that <i>you</i> are not allowed to kill a hare when you
like?"</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking so much about that," replied
Farmer Dobson, his eyes still bent very thoughtfully
downward&mdash;"I'm not thinking so much about that,
as I am wondering how, in the name of Old Nick,
these things came to be as they are. You see, Dick,
it was the same in my father's time, though I've
heard him say that my grandfather used to tell how,
in the time of the great troubles, folks killed game
when and where they liked; but that was only owing
to the unsettled state of things, for these laws about
the game were made before that time I take it,
Dick."</p>

<p>"According to what I've learned about it," said
Dick, looking still more proud than before, and
feeling himself superior in information to the rest of
the company, "these Game Laws, as they are called,
began with William the Conqueror, the king that
I dare say you've heard of, farmer, that came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
beyond the sea, and got possession of this country,
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Likely, likely," said the farmer, yawning, and
growing wearied of Dick's learning; "I don't care
two straws who first made such laws, Dick; but I'm
sure of one thing&mdash;that it must be wrong, when one
thinks on it, that the great folk should claim the
wild creatures God Almighty makes himself as their
own, when, all the while, they have no more right
to 'em than other folk."</p>

<p>"To be sure it's wrong, farmer," said Dick.
"What right could any man have, whether he
were a king, or a 'squire, or a parson, to say to all
the people of this country, or any other country,
'You shall none of you kill a stag, or a hare, or a
pheasant, under pain of losing a hand, or going to
prison?' The only wonder is, farmer, that people
have submitted to these laws so long and so quietly."</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Dick," continued the farmer,
whose common sense was of a more solid character
than Dick's, though his perceptions were not quite so
acute at the outset of an enquiry&mdash;"you see, Dick,
this law is contrived, like most other laws, to draw
a number of folk into the love and the liking of it:
it isn't simply <i>one</i> man <i>now</i>, whatever it might have
been formerly, that is interested in keeping up these
Game Laws. Rich folks generally think they ought
to do no other but uphold 'em. They say, that all
the game would soon be destroyed if every body was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
allowed to kill hares and pheasants when and where
they like. The 'squire, too, sends presents, you know,
to his acquaintances the great folk in London, and
elsewhere; and if hares and pheasants and partridges
were as common with poor folk as with rich, why,
the great folk would soon scorn to have 'em on their
tables. 'There are wheels within wheels,' as the
miller says, Dick. Rich folk are sure to hang together
on their side of the wheat-sack; and that is
the reason&mdash;more than their money, Dick, mind ye!
more than their money&mdash;why they are so much
more powerful than the poor. And for the self-same
reason that they <i>are</i> so powerful, Dick," concluded
the farmer, seeming determined to finish his speech
in spite of the poacher's evident dislike to it, "I
think it is far better for all who love peace and
quietness, and a whole skin, to keep out of harm's
way. You understand me, Dick! Come, dame, fill
us a good jug of ale, and let us have a bit of bread
and cheese, or a mouthful of bacon, and Dick and I
will talk these things over a bit, just in a quiet and
sensible way."</p>

<p>The dame hasted to set her hospitality before her
spouse and the poacher; and it soon became hard to
say which most excelled in the act of doing justice to
it. The strong ale, however, was most freely partaken
by the poacher, and, under its potency, Dick's tongue
soon began to indulge itself with a tolerably large
licence.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"I' faith, farmer," he said, "you gave me a roughish
reception when I crossed your threshold; you
must do things gentlier another time, when you're
disposed for a cramp: it's only a fool-hardy sort of a
thing to take a bull by the horns: it's ten times wiser,
when he makes a butt at you, to scratch him a bit,
and coax him, and smooth him down."</p>

<p>The farmer was a little nettled by Raven Dick's
taunting tone and the devilry of his eye; but he
thought one scuffle enough for a day, and so replied
with a somewhat forced look of good humour, "I
hardly think it's wisest at all times, Dick. I think,
for my own part, the only way sometimes is to take
a bull by the horns. And besides, Dick, whoever
heard o' such a thing as scratching a bull? You may
scratch an angry cur, you know, Dick," he concluded
with a laugh, "but a bull!&mdash;no, no, Dick, scratching
a bull won't do at all!"</p>

<p>"I know what I say, Farmer Dobson," cried Dick
aloud, thumping one hand upon the table, and pouring
the ale on the outside of the horn, instead of
into it, with the other, "I know what I say,&mdash;and I
say <i>scratching</i>!"</p>

<p>"Speak in the house, Dick!" retorted the farmer,
colouring, "thou wilt not talk better sense for shouting.
I tell thee that that bull's only a fool of a bull
that will stand scratching! Wilt thou make me believe,
think'st thou, that any body would be such a goose,
for instance, as to try to scratch my old white bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in the second home close? Thou won't venture to
scratch him, I'm pretty sartain, Dick, with all thy
brag and bluster to boot!"</p>

<p>"Won't I?" cried Dick, fiercely; "why, what do
ye fancy is to hinder me, eh! old clod-pate?"</p>

<p>"Dick, Dick!" said the farmer, cooling himself
with the remembrance that the poacher was a much
younger and inexperienced man than himself, and
tapping the wild youth admonishingly on the shoulder,
"it is far wiser for a man to go steadily about getting
his bread, than either to scratch bulls, or to snickle
hares, depend on't. I don't say but that you have as
much right to practise one as t'other, if you feel
inclined; only, you are almost sure to repent it in
the end, in either case: you understand me, Dick?"</p>

<p>"'Od dang it!" hiccupped Dick, setting his ragged
hat on one side, and looking at the farmer as if he
intended him to understand he was no ordinary hero,
"do ye think, Kiah Dobson, that I fear aught that
may happen? I say I <i>will scratch</i> your bull; ay,
and I'll tame him, too, as I've tamed you?"</p>

<p>"Better not," replied the farmer drily; "better
go quietly home, Dick, and try to earn thy living
honestly, like thy father and thy brother Ned."</p>

<p>"To Jericho with 'em both!" roared Raven Dick,
bouncing up from his seat: "they're fools both of
'em! I don't intend to slave for ever, and never have
any fun, like them. No, no! I'll have a hare when
I like; ay, and I'll scratch a bull when I like, too!&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>so
here goes!" and out sallied the intoxicated
poacher, snatching up the dead hares as he went, and
placing them under his arm as before. Farmer
Dobson and the dame followed, for their curiosity
was, naturally, too highly excited to permit their remaining
behind.</p>

<p>Just as Dick vaulted over the first hedge, for he
was in too heroic a vein to think of taking the stile,
though it was close by, Dick met one who was no
stranger to him. It was the squire's gamekeeper.
The moon shone brightly, and the gamekeeper
looked hard at Dick, and still harder at the hares
under his arm. But although the gamekeeper had
his gun with him as usual, he most likely felt unwilling
to encounter one so strong, and withal so
reckless as he knew Raven Dick to be, for he did not
speak to him. Dick spoke to the gamekeeper, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Heigho!" said he, "brother poacher! how are
you for fun? just stop and look at me, while I scratch
Kiah Dobson's old bull, will ye?" and off he went
along the hedge-row in quest of his new game, while
the gamekeeper and the farmer and his wife stood
gazing after him in astonishment.</p>

<p>Scarcely sooner said than done! Dick came up to
the bull as he lay in the pasture, quietly and unsuspectingly
chewing the cud, and Dick began to scratch
the bull. It need hardly be said that if Dick thought
this very funny, the horned beast's thoughts were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
another complexion. The bull rose, blurred, and ran
bang upon Dick, goring his ribs, throwing him up,
and, bounding to the other side of the field, left the
scratcher senseless upon the grass, and all before you
could have found breath to say, "Jack Robinson!"
had you been looking on, like the gamekeeper and
farmer and dame Dobson.</p>

<p>Nothing in the wide world could have given the
gamekeeper greater pleasure than Dick's overthrow.
"Farmer Dobson," said he, "now is the time to nab
the rascal: fetch your wheelbarrow, and we'll put
him into it, and take him away to the next constable's,
and he shall put him into the close-hole, till
justice can be had upon him: it will do the Squire's
heart good, I'm sure, to learn that we have noosed
the Raven at last, after he has noosed so many score
brace o' game."</p>

<p>Kiah Dobson's heart felt reluctant to assist in imprisoning
Dick, 'scapegrace, although he knew him to
be: but how could he refuse compliance with the request
of the squire's gamekeeper, for there lay the hares
by the poacher's side? Besides, as Kiah often used
to say, when he related the story in after years,
he reflected that although Dick was so good a logician
on the evils of the Game Laws, yet he had become
so outrageously daring in bidding defiance to danger,
that he feared ill would come on it, if a timely check
were not given to his course. So Kiah went and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
fetched the barrow, and he and the gamekeeper lifted
Dick into it, and away they wheeled him to the next
constable's house. A surgeon attended to Dick's
wounds, when he had brought him to his senses a
little; and, the next week, the squire himself, sitting
in judicial state at the hall of Manby, committed
Dick to the House of Correction for six months.</p>

<p>Dick found the labour of knocking hemp&mdash;the
usual employ of prisoners in the gaols of North
Lincolnshire at that period&mdash;to be but pitiful
"fun." And when he reflected that he would be
likely to come there again, or to some worse place,
if he ever afterwards ventured to renew his practice
of "snickling" hares, he steadily resolved to
"work like his father and his brother Ned," as Farmer
Dobson advised. Dick's views on the Game
Laws never altered; but he felt, after this sorrowful
experience, it would be worse than folly to dream of
violating them with impunity, in a country where
"the rich all hung together on their own side of the
wheat sack," as Kiah Dobson had observed. Now
and then, when he happened to have shaken hands
too freely with his old acquaintance Sir John Barleycorn,
even years after his imprisonment, Raven Dick
would be liable to relapse into some shade of his old
feeling, and putting on a "gallows-look," as the
landlord of the Harrows and Plough, in Froddingham,
used to call it, he would threaten to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
to his old trade. But there was one saying which,
when "passed about" on the long settle of the
public-house, was always sure to raise a hearty chorus
of laughter at Dick's expense, and to have the
effect of dispelling, in a twinkling, all Dick's dreams
of having more "fun:" it was&mdash;"Who scratched
the Bull?"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>TIM SWALLOW-WHISTLE, THE TAILOR;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tim Swallow-whistle, the tailor, lived at Horncastle,
a thriving little agricultural town in the centre
of Lincolnshire, and now well-known even to the
verge of Europe for its prodigious yearly horse
fair, to which Russ and Pruss, Netherlander and
Austrian, Frenchman, Swiss, and Italian, with even,
at times, the turban'd Turk, may be beheld flocking
to purchase from the rare show of steeds: "but
let that pass!" Tim was not one of your fashionable
tailors, it is true, but he was reckoned an "uncommon
neat hand" at his trade. Indeed, old Cocky
Davy, who was a very emperor among the Lincolnshire
tailors, always declared Tim to be the cleverest
apprentice that ever received his indentures at his
hands. Old Cocky&mdash;he was so termed on account
of the particular loftiness of his carriage&mdash;Old
Cocky had one especial maxim; it was, "Strike your
needle dead, you dog; and make your thread cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
'twang!'"&mdash;and no one apprentice that ever sat
upon Davy's shop-board so fully gratified his master
by the gallant and complete style in which he fulfilled
this maxim, as did Tim Swallow-whistle. Cocky
Davy was often heard to say&mdash;ay, and to swear it
too, when in his cups&mdash;that it did his heart good to
see the masterly manner in which Tim used to strike
the cloth. And then, for finishing a button-hole,
"Good heavens!"&mdash;Cocky Davy would declare in
the White Swan parlour, when the clock was on the
stroke of twelve&mdash;"why, Tim could turn the thing
off his fingers with every cast of the thread as regular
and exact as if he had worked it by geometry;" and
then Cocky would thump his pewter tankard with
vehement force upon mine host's white wooden table,
and call to have it refilled for the last time that
night.</p>

<p>It may easily be guessed that Tim Swallow-whistle
was not only a clever hand, but a hard-working lad,
while an apprentice, or otherwise he would not have
worn such excelling commendations from a master
who was quite as frequently found in the parlour of
the White Swan as in his own shop, and therefore
found it of incalculable value to himself to possess an
apprentice who would work hard while his master
played. Now, as a loitering apprentice usually makes
a worthless, idle man, so a diligent lad is almost invariably
found to carry his early habits of industry
into mature life, and to make a stirring and prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
citizen, unless some untoward circumstances arise
to bereave him of the power for exertion, or to deprive
him of its legitimate and well-deserved fruits.</p>

<p>Tim Swallow-whistle did not belie the promise of
his youth. He was full forty years old when the incidents
occurred we are about to relate; and up to
that time, as he used himself to say, "Nobody could
ever say he had an idle bone in his skin." But, let a
man be as industrious and well-disposed as he may,
ten to one but somebody or other in this crooked
world will be found determined to find fault with
him. So it was with Tim: he "minded his own
business" most emphatically; for he was regularly
found on his shop-board every morning, winter or
summer, as the clock struck five; and he seldom
quitted it before seven at night, unless on some
special holiday occasion: he "paid every one their
own"&mdash;that is to say, he kept no scores, either at
the baker's, the butcher's, the grocer's, or at the alehouse:
he had a whole coat on his back&mdash;though
there was, here and there, a patch in it of his own
neatest style of repair: and, to conclude the catalogue
of his competency in his own language, "he had
always something to eat when other folk went to
dinner."</p>

<p>Tim contrived to keep up to this standard of comparative
comfort, too, in spite of a breeding wife, who
had stocked his cottage with nine "small children,"
though he was not married till he was thirty. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
so many excellences, who could have thought that
any one would be bad enough to attempt to mar
Tim's well-earned happiness? But the world is, what
we have just termed it, a crooked world; and so
poor Tim was doomed to meet with undeserved
annoyance.</p>

<p>Just opposite Tim's little shop lived a great professor
of sour-godliness. Unluckily, he was not only
of the same homely trade with Tim, but was enabled
to hold up his head more loftily among his fellow-tradesmen,
by reason that a maiden aunt happened
to die and leave him a neat little freehold that
brought him in 50<i>l.</i> a-year, in addition to his earnings
by the shears, needle, and thimble. Jedediah
Prim&mdash;for so was this fortunate tailor called&mdash;was
adjudged by his neighbours to be ill-disposed
towards his poorer brother snip, solely because Tim
had always sufficient employ for himself and an apprentice,
whereas Prim's manners were so uninviting,
and his character so mean, that he barely
ensured occupation for his own solitary needle.</p>

<p>Since Prim, at heart, was a worshipper of Mammon
above all other gods, it was not at all wonderful
that he felt envious at his neighbour's trade. Nevertheless,
Prim ever affected the greatest scorn of these
neighbourly charges of avarice and envy, and most
piously averred that he had no other distaste to "the
man over the way," as he called Tim, than that which
was created in his soul by "the ungodly man's profaneness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
"He is every day selling his soul to
Satan by the whistling of the Evil One's own tunes!"
was Prim's godly lamentation over the evil ways of
his neighbour. This was a severe hit at the only
kind of recreation in which poor Tim indulged. He
had been a hard whistler, as well as a hard worker,
from a lad; and from the peculiarity of his way of
whistling, which very much resembled an endless
twitter, Tim caught the curious <i>soubriquet</i> of "Swallow-whistle"
among his fellow-apprentices at Cocky
Davy's, and kept it to his dying day.</p>

<p>Now, whistling or twittering are but very humble
kinds of melody, but I care not however lowly or
merely imitative may be the degree of the divine
faculty of music that a human creature may be endowed
with, I'll warrant him, there will be something
like real nobility of heart or mind about him, let his
vocation and whereabouts in this ill-arranged world
be what it may. And truly, so much might, without
hesitancy, be affirmed of twittering Tim the tailor of
Horncastle. With all his knowledge of the ill-will
borne towards him by Prim the puritan, Tim Swallow-whistle
would have sprung off his shop-board like
a bounding fawn, and with a bounding heart of joy,
to have done the envious Jedediah a good turn. Yet,
with all his bountiful good-nature, Tim possessed a
fair share of shrewdness. He had lived long enough
to learn that over-weening envy usually overshoots
its mark, and most severely punishes its own voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
slaves. Thus, of all men in the little town of
Horncastle, Tim Swallow-whistle was least disturbed
at what every one talked of as a scandalous matter,
namely, the envy and malevolence of Jedediah Prim,
the religious tailor. "Never mind; 'every dog has
his day!'" Tim would reply, and twitter away again,
to every successive tale his neighbours brought him,
about what Prim said, and what Prim did: for you
never knew of two neighbours being "at outs" in
your life, but a host of voluntary messengers, on
either side, could be found to fetch and carry fuel to
maintain the heat between them.</p>

<p>What moved Tim Swallow-whistle more than any
other event in his life was the fact of Prim the puritan
being made overseer of the poor, and throwing
Tim's poor old grandmother entirely upon his maintenance.
The aged woman had nearly reached a
century of years; and, at the mere cost of half-a-crown
per week to the parish, was nursed in her
second childhood by Tim's widowed mother, who
lived in a little cottage, hard by her son. Tim had
willingly, nay eagerly, contributed to supply the
wants of the two aged women through all the difficulties
felt by a man situated as he was, with an increasing
family, for there was not a grain of sordidness
in his noble nature; but it was no joke for poor
Tim to have the entire weight of the burthen cast
upon him. For several days after the announcement
was formally made him&mdash;and pious Prim took care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to have the devilish satisfaction of performing the
annoying business himself&mdash;poor Tim suspended his
twittering, and "struck his needle dead" in a savage
mood of reflection. Tim's reflection ended, however,
in the way that, with such a heart, it was natural
for it to end,&mdash;in the manly resolve that he would
work the very skin off his fingers, and go without a
meal every day in the week, rather than permit his
old grandmother to want. "Every dog has his
day!" echoed Tim, recovering his wonted elasticity of
spirits; "Jedediah Prim will not be overseer of the
poor for the parish of Horncastle to all eternity;"
and away he burst into a mellifluous twitter that
floated, in the form of "Merrily danced the Quakers,"
gaily across the street, and entered into the very
"porches of the ears" of Prim the puritan, much
to the deadly annoyance of that heart of envy. During
the continuance of Tim's overture for the day,
there entered into his cottage a travelling tinker, who
besought leave of the tailor to light his pipe.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, and welcome," blithely answered Tim;
and away he went twittering his old burthen of
"Merrily danced the Quakers."</p>

<p>"Marry, good faith, maister!" said the tinker,
folding his arms and looking as if he felt inclined for
'a bit of chat,' as they say in Lincolnshire; "why,
that was the very tune my poor old mother was so
fond of! I can't help feeling fond on't, d'ye know,
maister; for my mother was a good mother to me&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Lord rest her soul!" and the hardy tinker's voice
faltered in a way that showed his heart had its tender
place, notwithstanding his rough exterior. Tim's
twittering was arrested; the tinker had touched him
on a tender chord, and his whole heart vibrated, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Sit you down a while, friend, and smoke your
pipe quietly," said Tim, pointing to a seat near his
shop-board; "I'll tell our Becky to get out the
copper kettle for you to mend as soon as she comes
down stairs; we haven't used it these three years for
want o'mending."</p>

<p>"And times have been too hard for you to have it
mended before, I reckon, maister," said the tinker.</p>

<p>"Nay, as for that," replied Tim with a smile and
a shake of the head, "they're not much mended now;
I find it to be only a cross-grained world, I'll assure
you, friend; but I always make it a maxim to take
things as easy as I can; for, as I always say, 'Every
dog has his day,' and among the rest of the poor
dogs one doesn't know but one's own turn to have
a day may come yet."</p>

<p>"Right, maister, right!" ejaculated the tinker,
drawing a full breath at his pipe, and puffing out a
full cloud of satisfaction; "there's sartainly a comfort
in thinking so: yet it isn't a pleasing thing to
be striving to do one's best, and to pay every one
their own, and yet to be trampled upon, as poor folks
too commonly are in this world."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Very true, friend," chimed in Tim Swallow-whistle,
assenting readily to a remark that reminded
him so strikingly of his own experience; "very true:
there's nothing that gives an honest man any uneasiness
equal to that: for my part, I've no wish to be
richer or loftier than my neighbours; but I must say
the man must feel it hard who's ill-used, after striving
to do the best he can for everybody as well as
himself."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, maister, it shows that what the
Scripter says is true, 'that money is the root of all
evil,'" rejoined the tinker; "for you'll always observe
that a man begins to trample upon you as soon
as he happens to begin to get on in the world a little
better than yourself."</p>

<p>"'Tis too often the case, friend," said Tim, not
fully approving of the tinker's sweeping remark, but
still feeling the forceful truth of it in his own case;
"and yet I can't understand how it should be so."</p>

<p>"At any rate, maister," said the tinker, interrupting
the other, "one can understand one thing:
that if things could be put more on a level in this
world, there wouldn't be such foul dealings as we see
now; for if one man wasn't allowed to be so much
stronger in the pocket than another, all men would
be more likely to gain respect; all this bowing and
scraping of poor to rich would be at an end, I mean."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," interjected the tailor, stopping his
needle when it was but half way through the cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and feeling a disposition to be abstracted; "that's
true enough&mdash;true enough, friend: but for my part
I don't see how the vast difference between the rich
and the poor is to be remedied. You see it's the
nat'ral course of things: some folk are idle, and
others unlucky; while money makes money, when a
man once gets hold on't&mdash;that is, if he tries to turn
it over, and takes care of it as it gathers."</p>

<p>"Just so, maister; that's all very true as far as it
goes," rejoined the tinker; "but I think that's not
exactly what the parson calls the end o' the chapter.
I'm but a plain man, and no great scholar; but I
always take Brimmijem and Sheffield in my yearly
round, and one hears a bit o' long headed-talk, maister,
now and then in such places: you'll excuse me
if I tell you a little of what I think about these
things."</p>

<p>"Prythee, don't mention that, in that sort of a
way," said Tim, hastily; "I'll assure thee that
there's nobody likes a man that speaks his mind
better than I do."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, maister," continued the tinker; "then
I'll tell you what I think: I think there ought to be a
law to compel folk that make money so fast to use it
in making their fellow-creatures happy, instead of
spending it on finery and foolishness."</p>

<p>"Why, you would make folks kind and good by
law then, friend! Hum! I can't see," disputed
Tim, again suspending his needle, and looking very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
metaphysically upon the corner pane of his shop
window, "I can't see how that scheme would be
likely to succeed. Excuse me, friend, but I think
you are talking about may-be's that'll never fly."</p>

<p>"Look ye, now, maister," resumed the tinker,
laying down his pipe, raising his hand with the fore-finger
pointed, and looking greatly in earnest to
substantiate his theory; "this is my point: God
Almighty made us all of the same flesh and blood,
not some of china and the rest of brown marl: he
made us to live like brothers; and if one had better
wit than the rest, it was his duty to use it for the
benefit of all his brothers and sisters, as well as for
his own benefit. So, if a man by money makes
money, since he can't do that without the help of
other folk, I maintain that that money ought to be
distributed, and all that it will buy, for the benefit
of all, but more especially for the comfort of those
whom the money-maker made use of in making his
money."</p>

<p>"You mean, if I understand you," said Tim
Swallow-whistle, looking as much like a logician as
he knew how, in order to keep the tinker in countenance&mdash;"you
mean, my friend, that when men
with full pockets employ men with empty ones, and
by the labour of the poor make their full pockets
flow over, there ought to be a fairer division of the
profit."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I mean, maister," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the tinker, smiling with enthusiasm, "you have
hit the nail on the head, completely: I think there
ought to be a law, ay, and I think it's more needed
than any other law, to prevent the rich from employing
the poor just for what wages they please,
and to so order things that every man who makes
money by other men's labour shall be compelled to
give his workmen such a share of his profits as will
enable them and their wives and children to live in
decency and comfort, instead of rich men being allowed
to grow richer and wantoner every day, while
their poor slaves go, often, with naked backs and
hungry bellies. Ah, maister," concluded the tinker
in a tone where the heart was heard, "you know
little about the real suffering there is in England;
but I can tell you one thing,&mdash;and that is, that in
the manufacturing places, where this pinch-gut
system is most felt, thousands say they won't stand
it much longer!"</p>

<p>The tinker ended this speech in a tone of voice so
loud that Tim Swallow-whistle felt prompted to look
round him for listeners. To his great chagrin, Prim
the Puritan stood pricking his ears, but a few yards
from Tim's door, with his back turned towards it,
but evidently collecting every seditious syllable
uttered by the travelling tinker. Tim placed his
fore-finger significantly to his lips; and the tinker,
marking the direction of Tim's eyes, took the hint,
and immediately turned the conversation to the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of the copper tea-kettle. The tailor's wife was
called down-stairs; the kettle was produced; the bargain
was readily struck; and the tinker proceeded,
out of doors, with his vocation. Tim Swallow-whistle,
meanwhile, being left to uninterrupted reflection,
turned over and over again, in his mind, the
weighty thoughts which had been started by the traveller.
Tim could not easily quell the indignation
against money-making oppression which the tinker's
tale had raised within him; and the plain man's plain
reasoning, respecting the rights of the labouring poor,
appeared to him uncontradictable; yet all his sympathies
for the distressed yielded, at length, to the
strength of his common sense, and the consciousness
that, care as much as he might, he could not alter the
state of the oppressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The world is <i>as it is</i>," said Tim to himself, mustering
up as much wisdom as he was master of; "it
has not been right this many a long year, if all that
our forefathers said can be true: and, what's worse,
one doesn't see much chance of its being speedily set
to rights. But what's the use of grumbling at it,
day after day? that would only whitter the flesh off
one's poor bones. No, no; what the man says is
true enough, no doubt," concluded the soliloquising
Swallow-whistle; "but I will not make myself uneasy
about what I can't mend: at least I won't any
further than I can help. Let the world wag! I'll try
to make myself as easy as I can in it, with all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
awkwardness. Every dog has his day,&mdash;and perhaps
mine will come yet."</p>

<p>This was no elevated moral channel in which Tim's
thoughts were running when the tinker re-entered;
but it was one which had served to drain Tim's
heart from the troublous inundation of discontent,
amid the toils and difficulties of his whole mature
life. Tim invited the tinker to take another pipe,
and entered on the old subject in a way that showed
his mind was made up.</p>

<p>"Well, my good friend," he began, "I have been
thinking about what has fallen to your lot to see;
and I must take the liberty to tell you, that although
I cannot help feeling grieved for the distress of others,
yet I very much doubt the wisdom of a man dwelling
on these thoughts of sorrow till he feels a disposition
to be discontented with every thing around
him."</p>

<p>"So do I, maister," chimed in the tinker, interrupting
Tim,&mdash;"so do I: but when one sees and hears of
things that one knows to be wrong, one can hardly
prevent one's sen, you know, from turning 'em over
in one's mind, and trying to think how they could be
righted. I'm not a man given to low spirits, mysen,
maister; I contrive to keep my heart up, and go on;
though I don't think the world's quite right, for all
that."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear what you said just now," continued
Tim: "I assure you I've some little rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
usage to bear; but I always find cheerfulness, and a
disposition to make the best o'things, by far the wisest
way of living."</p>

<p>"So do I, maister," again burst in the tinker, very
much to the annoyance of the tailor, who wanted to
come to the end of his "say," without interruption&mdash;"so
do I; only, you know there's no harm in talking
about these things, now and then. And, besides,
maister, you know, the world never will be any better,
if we all shut our eyes, and say we see no wrong
in it."</p>

<p>"Right, very right," replied Tim, a little bit put
out of the path he had intended to take, but still
resolved to make direct for his point, if he could; "I
don't deny that: but how long will it be before the
world is bettered, even if we keep our eyes open, and
tell aloud of all the wrong we know in it? You and
I are not the first who have discovered the world to
be wrong, depend on't. Tinkers and tailors," continued
Tim, smiling as he proceeded, "have been
found in many countries, as far as my little book-larning
informs me, who have imagined they could
repair the rents in the world; but, in too many
cases, these fellows were the very greatest practisers
upon the helplessness of their weaker brethren. As
for the few who have been in earnest, they have
usually been silenced, in one way or other, by those
whose interest it was to keep up the wrong in the
world. That the world never will be better," concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Tim, "I will not undertake to say; but the
day, I fear, is so far distant, my good friend, that you
and I will neither of us be likely to live to see it.
Don't take it amiss; but I can't help thinking so."</p>

<p>The tinker was ready with an answer; but two
customers of Tim's here came in, and the travelling
tinker, thinking that it would be both ill-mannered
and wearisome to the tailor for him to stay, and
attempt to renew the conversation, wished Tim
"Good day," and prepared to set out again on his
journey. Tim extended his hand, and returned the
tinker's friendly gripe in a way that told the traveller
his few strong hints would be thought of on another
day.</p>

<p>With all Tim Swallow-whistle's shrewdness, he
was perfectly free from craft. The thoughts created
in his mind by this conversation with the travelling
tinker naturally found their way, now and then, into
his exchanges of opinion with his customers. Prim
the Puritan was not slow in learning this: in fact,
his evil nature had plotted Tim's destruction from
the moment that he overheard the conversation between
Tim and the tinker. Spies were sent to draw
the tailor out; and, eventually, poor Tim was set
down in the day-book of every influential man in
Horncastle as a "dangerous and seditious fellow."
From that day, poor Tim Swallow-whistle's business
began to decline. The trial was a bitter one to Tim;
for his aged grandmother sank to the grave, beholding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the clouds of adversity gather around her grandchild's
dwelling; but, in the serenity of death,
steadfastly directed her weeping descendant to trust
in uprightness, and it would be his comfort. Then
his mother sickened and died,&mdash;yielding, after a hard
struggle, to the Last Enemy, but expiring with an
exultant smile, after assuring her child that her own
greatest consolation was that she had been dutiful to
her mother, and she was confident he would yet see
bright days as the reward of his spotless filial piety.</p>

<p>In vain Tim asked for parochial relief in the hour
of his sore straitness, when his wife's health failed
with the labour of waiting upon her sick relatives,
and when Tim's earnings dwindled to a starving pittance
by reason of his being compelled to wait upon
those around him that could not help themselves.
Prim held the purse-strings of the parish tight. Tim
fasted often when his neighbours fed, and fed well:
but he never despaired. "Every dog has his day,"
he still thought, but refrained from saying much, and
still battled with thoughts that would have unmanned
him.</p>

<p>Tim was repeating to himself his old adage one
afternoon, about six months after his mother's death,
when the clergyman of the parish entered his cottage,
and, to Tim's indescribable surprise, desired Tim to
take the measure of him for a new suit! Now the
fact was, that the clergyman was, necessarily, more
than once in Tim's dwelling during the successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
illnesses of his grandmother and mother; and, although
prejudiced against the tailor, from the reports
circulated to his detriment, yet he was too sensible a
man not to use his opportunities of scrutinising Tim's
real character, and too much a gentleman, in the best
sense of the word, to permit a poor but worthy man
to suffer if his own help could avail to relieve him.
The clergyman saw that Tim wore his heart too
much on the outside of his waistcoat to be a rogue;
and the clergyman determined to help Tim by his
patronage and his "good word."</p>

<p>The prejudices against Tim, however, were not
dispelled all at once, though many began to look
upon him with new eyes when they heard that the
town-parson had actually given him orders for a
new suit. The climax of the poor tailor's sorrows
was now, however, gone by; and the future was
preparing for him its triumphs and joys. One
event gave him some trouble; but what kind of
trouble? Ah! it was of that kind which is most
truly troublous to a heart which has struggled to
train itself into correctness. The termination of
Prim's two years of overseership arrived, and the
parish vestry would not pass his accounts, having
discovered him to be guilty of an immense embezzlement!
Tim had real trouble with his own heart
throughout the whole of the day on which he first
learnt this fact. Exultation over his old enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the feeling that strove to be uppermost; but Tim
virtuously kept it down.</p>

<p>Succeeding years displayed a striking contrast in
the lives of Tim Swallow-whistle and Prim the
Puritan. The houses which the cheating overseer
had recently bought with the fruits of his fraud were
sold to raise law-expenses; even his aunt's freehold
went to the hammer for the same purpose: and Prim
only escaped a prison by some technical flaw in the
wording of the proceedings taken out against him.
He was ruined, however, and became comparatively
a beggar, while his character sank for life. Tim's
honesty and industry, on the other hand, raised him
daily in the estimation of his neighbours. Competence,
amounting, at length, well-nigh to wealth,
beamed upon him, and, ere his grey hairs went down
to the grave, he lived to leave a crown-piece, often,
at the door of the ragged and wretched man who
was once his envious persecutor and the oppressive
overseer.&mdash;Tim Swallow-whistle preserved, even to
his dying day, that nobility of heart which forbade
him to triumph over a fallen enemy; but he would
often repeat, half mechanically, to himself, when
passing from the poverty-stricken door of Prim the
Puritan, "<i>Every dog has his day</i>."</p>

<h2>DAVY LIDGITT, THE CARRIER;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIS NINEPENCE TO NOUGHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Louth, sixty years ago, as now, was the handsomest
as well as the largest town in the north of Lincolnshire,
though you would not then have seen in it, as
you may now, if you go that way, a dashing mail-coach,
with a dashing red-coated and gold-laced
guard, dash off and dash in daily to and from Rasen,
and Gainsborough, and Sheffield. "Long" Ludforth,
too&mdash;(they spell it "Ludford" on the maps;
but, doubtless, they who live there know better the
name of the place than your mere map-makers!)&mdash;Long
Ludforth, too, was nearly as deserving of its
name, then, as now. And, in default of all other
means of conveyance for goods and passengers, Davy
Lidgitt, the carrier, traversed the ten miles of distance
between the village and market-town "every
Wednesday and Saturday&mdash;twice a week, regular,"
as the inscription read on the front of his neat tilted
cart; for your new-fangled way of sticking the carrier's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
name on one side of his vehicle had not then
been invented by the tax-making gentry at head-quarters.</p>

<p>Davy Lidgitt was excelled in diligence and punctuality
by never a carrier, even in those diligent and
punctual times, and gained the universal respect of
his employers, and, what was of more solid value, a
neat little independence, to boot, as the reward of
his life of industry and uprightness. Davy,&mdash;it
should be "Old Davy;" for that was the name by
which he was known for the greater part of his
public life,&mdash;Old Davy would have felt himself to
be a happy man could he have regarded young Davy,
his son, as one who was likely to tread, morally as
well as physically, in his steps. But Old Davy Lidgitt,
like all other mortals, lacked the single ingredient
in his cup which could give it the power of
making his bliss complete on this side the grave.</p>

<p>Not that young Davy was idle, or profligate, or
devoid of wit, according to some people's acceptation
of the term. In fact, the majority of the plain villagers
of Long Ludforth agreed that, "if aught, young
Davy Lidgitt had ower much wit for one of his
calling." And, for activity, few could match young
Davy. From a mere child he aspired to wield his
father's long whip, and at ten years old could manage
the brown mare and the black horse that composed
the carrier's team as well as Old Davy himself
could manage them. Moreover, he was always to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
found about the cart or the stable, at the market-town,
when the goods were delivered, and could
never be tempted to spend either his time, health, or
money at the ale-tap. Up to the age of five-and-twenty,&mdash;when
Old Davy, at sixty, fully retired to
enjoy the brief remnant of life in the snug but small
cottage he had purchased,&mdash;young Davy had not
failed to accompany his father as regularly as Wednesday
and Saturday returned in each week to Louth
and back, attending so rigidly and cleverly to every
item of parcel and package, letter and message, that
the villagers would one and all declare "young Davy
Lidgitt had a head like an almanack!"</p>

<p>"Why, what in the world, then, could it be," you
will ask, "that caused old Davy to look upon a lad,
with his son's commendations, in the light of disparagement?"
If the truth must be told, we must
begin at the beginning. Young Davy showed sundry
symptoms of a disposition that his father did not like,
even when a child: he would hook the gears one day
in one mode and another day in another, often to the
provocation of some such harsh exclamation on the
part of the senior Lidgitt, as&mdash;"'Od rabbet thee!
thou'st been at thy kickshaw tricks again, with the
old mare's belly-band: she'll be kicking thy busy
brains out some of these days!" And many a kick,
to say troth, young Davy received for these "kickshaw"
tricks: but he persevered, with the belief that
the way of harnessing a cart-horse might be improved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Yet his father could never discern that either in this
or any other of his displays of genius, such as
clipping or tying the manes of the horses in whimsical
forms, or hanging their collars, and halters, and
so forth, in "apple-pie order," as the old man called it,
in the home stable&mdash;I say, old Davy could never
arrive at the conclusion that young Davy, in any of
these intended "improvements" ever effected a real
one.</p>

<p>"But, Lord love thee, Davy!" Betty Lidgitt
would usually say, when her spouse had been relating
his boy's latest whim, in her ears, at supper-time,&mdash;"Lord
love thee, Davy, he's only a child; and thou
knaws childer will be childer: one can't set old heads
upo' young shouthers: he'll give over with his
meagrims when he grows older: thou wants patientness,
Davy,&mdash;patientness! Thou knaws I tell'd thee
so, before we were married!"</p>

<p>These pleasant motherly excuses for the lad quieted
the father for some years; but, one day, when the
young "Reformer" had proceeded so far as to take
away the horse-shoe from the door-jamb,&mdash;that mystic
surety of good luck to the cottage by the opinions
of every inhabitant of Long Ludforth, and which the
parson had never said was wrong,&mdash;old Davy could
forbear no longer to put into execution a resolve that
had been for some months forming in his mind.</p>

<p>"Betty! I'll take him to Wise Tom, and have his
planet ruled!" said he, "for I feel sartain and sewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
some'at isn't right about the lad: he's the very devil
for mischief! Lord ha' marcy on us, if the young
varment hasn't tucken the horse-shoe away now!
some'at will be happening us I'm sewer!"</p>

<p>And, on the following Monday morning, when his
team had rested a day after their usual Saturday's
travel, old Davy Lidgitt arose betimes, and, calling
up his son, set forth with him on the way to Welton,
to visit the astrologer.</p>

<p>It will be long before the memory of old Tom Cussitt,
"the wise man of Welton," will be forgot in Lindsey.
"Cusworth" was his proper name, but old Lindsey
folk made it a rule to shorten folks' names when they
had to use them often, and there were few names
more frequently in a peasant's mouth, at that time of
the day, for twenty miles round Louth, than that of
"Tom Cussitt." Good Lord! if one were to tell all
the stories one has heard of his discoveries of stolen
goods by the stars; of the marks he was wont to put
on the thieves, that the owners of the goods might
know the rogues when they saw 'em; of the wondrous
way in which he could show a love-sick maiden her
future husband in the old-fashioned witch-looking
mirror that hung in his darkened room; and of the
strange facts he foretold to some people, when he
"cast their nativities,"&mdash;that mystic process in
which he never erred a hair's breadth,&mdash;why, it
would take a twelvemonth to go through the labour!
But, to attend to old and young Davy. It was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
half-a-dozen miles from Long Ludforth to Welton,
and so they and their little team were soon there.</p>

<p>Young Davy, it may be guessed, gazed hard at the
"Wise Man," and thought him an awful-looking
personage, though Tom Cussitt was, at that time of
day, a somewhat handsome-looking man. His fine
clear blue eye was not, as yet, overhung with those
bushy, unsightly brows that marked him in old age;
his fair, ruddy skin was not, as yet, disfigured and
concealed by the filthy long gray beard he afterwards
wore; nor had his fine manly height yet contracted
a stoop. Old Davy had often seen Wise Tom before,
having frequently conveyed customers to his cottage,
and therefore he did not stare at him with wonder or
surprise, like the lad. As for Tom, he, of course,
stared at neither father nor son, being quite prepared,
like Sidrophel, to say to every comer&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"I did expect you here, and knew,</div>
<div class="i0">Before you spake, your business, too."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Not that Tom Cussitt was one of your ordinary
conjurers,&mdash;your mere schemers who take up the
trade to scrape a shilling from the gulls among mankind.
Many a rich man has gone from Tom's door
without being able, although he proffered pounds to
the star-gazer, to obtain one syllable from him in
solution of the great problem of futurity which the
rich man desired so much to know. Nor did Tom
usually set about the process of solving a "horary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
question," or "telling a fortune," with the imposing
forms of books and almanacks. On some special
occasions he would resort, like other clerks of the
starry craft, to these learned appearances; but, more
customarily, a single strong pithy remark, or two,
delivered over his pipe, and in the course of a general
conversation in which he engaged his visitors, comprised
the gist of his prophecy respecting the future
life of an inquirer, or of his direction for the recovery
of stolen goods or chattels. Whatever might
be the wise man's own confidence in the rules of
prognostication by the stars, every shrewd observer
noted that the prophet delivered his oracles rather by
the gauge and admeasurement which his strong common
sense enabled him to form of human character,
and the accuracy by which it enabled him to judge
of circumstances, than by any exercise of mathematical
or other description of learned skill.</p>

<p>Old Davy was too full with the budget of young
Davy's vagaries to need much craft on the part of one
who wished to draw him out. The Wise Man quickly
kenned what kind of stuff the young chap was made
of, and did not feel that it required any great exercise
of his wisdom to ken it, either. Old Davy, however,
with all his fears for the lad's capricious inclinations,
and their probable consequences when he himself
might be lain in the grave, was scarcely prepared for
the stunning severity of the single definitive sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
wherewith Wise Tom summed up his prophecy of
young Davy's "fortune."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Maister Cussitt," said Davy the elder,
taking his pipe from his mouth, after the lapse of an
hour's chat, "and so what do you think of him?
I've tell'd you the day, I'm sewer, quite exact; and
I've told you the hour at which Betty brought him
into the world, as near as I can remember."</p>

<p>"Reach us a spell, my lad!" said Cussitt to the
younger Davy, and pointed to a neat wire case that
hung against the wall, and contained long strips of
paper wrapped up for pipe-lighters.</p>

<p>"You'll want two," said the very sharp lad, "for
my fayther's pipe's out, an' all!"</p>

<p>"Is it, lad?" said old Davy, looking eagerly into
the head of his pipe. "Lord! what eyes thou hast!
there's nothing can 'scape thee, I declare!" And he
chuckled with pleasure at his boy's acuteness.</p>

<p>"And so what think you, then," he asked again&mdash;"what
think you, Maister Cussitt, will be our Davy's
luck?"</p>

<p>Young Davy had just lighted the two spells, had
held them to the pipes, severally, and had thrown
the papers, neither of them half consumed, upon
the fire.</p>

<p>"Think!" exclaimed the wise man, eyeing the
youngster fiercely, and glancing at the father with
a look that seemed to ask if there was now any need
to tell what he thought&mdash;"think!" said he; "why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
that he'll bring his ninepence to nought!" And he
thrust his middle finger into the pipe-head to put
out the fire in the tobacco, and placed the pipe,
sternly, on the mantle-piece.</p>

<p>Old Davy's face fell; and he also laid down his
pipe. Tom Cussitt took his large-skirted hat from
the peg, called to his maid for the milking-kit, and
prepared, according to his wont, to go forth and milk
his cows; for he followed husbandry in humble and
industrious style during the greater part of his life,
notwithstanding his astrological profession. "Good
morning, Davy Lidgitt!" he said; and left father
and son, alike wonder-stricken, by the fire-side.</p>

<p>There, however, they did not remain many minutes,
but were on their way to Ludforth; and a
melancholy way it seemed to old Davy. Betty Lidgitt
felt as melancholy as her husband when he had
related Tom Cussitt's laconic prophecy. Yet she
strove to comfort her spouse with the encouraging
remembrance, that "the Wise Man had not said
much; and, for the little that he did say, why,
belike, it was meant more for caution than aught
worse." Old Davy was willing to think so, but
could not succeed in persuading himself of it; and,
indeed, young Davy showed "too much of the cloven
foot," as his father somewhat sourly said, at times,
"to lead a body to think that the imp of mischief
would ever leave him;" so that, to his dying day,
poor old Davy would, ever and anon, sigh over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
remembrance of Tom Cussitt's short but sorrowfully
significant saying.</p>

<p>The story would become tiresome by going over
the catalogue of a thousandth part of young Davy
Lidgitt's doings in the "improving way," during the
dozen years that intervened between the visit to the
Wise man of Welton and old Davy's retirement from
business as a carrier. Nor is it needful to chronicle
similar deeds of the son that occurred from that
period to the day of the father's death,&mdash;though
some of these latter sorely harassed the old man's
temper,&mdash;especially young Davy's purchase of
coloured collars for the horses, and a fancy tilt, that
cost thrice the price of the old one, and let in the
rain! It was when old Davy was "safe under the
sod," as the sexton said when he had finished the
covering of his grave, and clapped it soundly with
his spade in token of admiration for his own work,&mdash;it
was then that young Davy began to let all the world
in Long Ludforth see there was a man amongst them
that possessed brains.</p>

<p>First, the "reformer" pulled down his father's low
cottage, and engaged a swaggering builder to erect a
tall four-storied house of brick, with a slated roof, on
the same spot, taking in the little spot that had
glowed so delightfully for many a year with roses,
and pansies, and marigolds. True, the purse of two
hundred spade-aces, left by his economical parent,
did not suffice to finish the house in the style he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
devised; so he warned the bricklayer to stop at three
stories, and to leave out some of the fantastic stone
ornaments he had procured at Louth. He sold the
ornaments and some of the other extra materials which
had already been brought upon his premises; but he
permitted a tradesman to take them on credit, and
was never paid for them. Then, finding the house
was likely to remain unroofed for lack of money, he
was constrained to go a-borrowing; but the errand
and the reception he met reminded him strongly of
one of his old father's sayings, which he used to think
very simple when the old man was alive,&mdash;"He
that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing!"&mdash;but
young Davy did not think the proverb quite so simple,
now. The farmers shook their heads at him,
wherever he went, and said "No;" without a syllable
of preface or addenda. And as for the monied men
at Louth, they had all taken their gauge of young
Davy Lidgitt, as well as the Wise Man of Welton;
and the "man of improvements" could only borrow
on a hard mortgage.</p>

<p>"And who are you to put into this new house
when it is finished, <i>Mister</i> Lidgitt?" asked Grumley,
the grocer, of Louth, very politely, one day, as he
was riding past, and saw young Davy standing by to
look at the builders.</p>

<p>Young Davy looked foolish at the question; for,
having neither father nor mother, brother nor sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
in the world, he could only answer that he had no one
to put into it but himself.</p>

<p>The grocer earnestly begged his company to dinner,
when he next came to Louth; and young Davy
felt so much flattered by so unusual an invitation,
that he instantly accepted it. And young Davy
found Mr. Grumley very cordial, and Mrs. Grumley
exceedingly kind,&mdash;but, above all, the <i>Misses</i> Grumley
were the most interesting creatures he had ever
seen! The eldest, especially, won his respect,&mdash;or,
he did not exactly know what to call it,&mdash;for he
had thought more about improvements in horses,
and carts, and stables, and houses, than aught else,
all his life. But the eldest Miss&mdash;<i>the</i> Miss Grumley,
by emphasis of courtesy&mdash;talked so sensibly
about the clever improvements that young Mr.
Brown had made in his farm-house, at Raithby, now
his father was dead; and how he had married Miss
Green, the chandler's daughter, and had bought such
a nice gig!</p>

<p>To tell the reader at once, what he plainly sees
is about coming to pass, young <i>Mister</i> Davy Lidgitt
married <i>Miss</i> Grumley; and he also bought a
nice gig&mdash;but it was bought on credit!</p>

<p>Proceeding with his "reforms" and "improvements,"
Davy turned <i>daily</i> carrier from Long Ludforth
to Louth, in a smart, light van, having disposed
of his father's old cart. But now young Davy began
<i>to think</i>,&mdash;not willingly, but perforce,&mdash;for bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
were pouring in upon him that he could not pay.
But Mr. Grumley was ready to <i>join in a note</i>, since
young Davy had already performed that kindness,
more than once, for his father-in-law. Still young
Davy was compelled to think; for, more than once,
his grand <i>daily</i> trip in the new van to Louth did not
afford freightage enough to cover the expense of the
two toll-gates which "improvement" had set up
between Long Ludforth and Louth market-place.
So Davy fell off to "every other day" as a carrier.
This was his first retrograde "reform," but, alas! it
was not his last.</p>

<p>Expenses daily became heavier. Mrs. Lidgitt was
gay when a grocer's daughter in a market town;
but she felt it requisite and becoming to "take the
lead" in dress, since her settlement in a village,
where the affair, too, was so comparatively easy. And
then, in the course of two years, two little Lidgitts
were squalling about the house; and, in addition to
one regular maid-servant, and an occasional help from
a stable-boy, a nurse was introduced as a constant
member of Davy's household establishment.</p>

<p>The visit of a lawyer, one day, put the family into
a flutter. Davy was taken aside, and informed that
Mr. So-and-so had resolved to call in his mortgage.
Davy's heart sunk, until he thought he must have
dropped; but how overjoyed he became when Lawyer
Gripple so cheerfully offered himself as mortgagee to
succeed his client Mr. So-and-so! Yet, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
new mortgage-deed was completed, Davy found himself,
somehow or other, a hundred pounds more in
debt for his house than before!</p>

<p>Young Davy Lidgitt now began to <i>think</i> more
deeply, and proposed some curtailments of weekly
expenditure to his wife; but she wept so passionately
at the mention of them, that Davy's heart smote him
for his cruelty. Then he tried to resolve on lessening
his own "appearances;" but pride gat the better of
him, and he dashed along, till at the end of one more
year, Lawyer Gripple suddenly "called in his money,"
and followed up the call ere Davy could answer it, or
procure another friend, by taking possession of Davy's
house, and telling him that thenceforth he ceased to
be any thing but a tenant, and for that title must pay
him&mdash;Lawyer Gripple&mdash;twenty pounds a-year.</p>

<p>Before Davy could recover his surprise at this
rapacious deed, Mr. Grumley failed in very heavy
responsibilities, with very small assets, and young
Davy was sent to prison for the debts to which he
had pledged himself on account of his father-in-law.</p>

<p>To end a sorrowful story as speedily as possible, it
remains but to say, that when poor Davy got out of
gaol he found his wife and her children nearly starving
and in rags, and living in a scanty, down-coming
cottage, not half the size of that wherein his father and
mother had lived so many years in contentment and
prosperity&mdash;his house was not only entirely gone, but
his van and horses were sold, and his business had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
passed, months before, into the hands of an industrious
stranger.</p>

<p>Penniless, sick, and wretched, poor Davy Lidgitt
was compelled to apply to the parish for bread, and
he had no alternative but to obey their direction, and
break stones on the road!</p>

<p>He was beheld in that employ for many years
after&mdash;a fallen, broken-spirited man;&mdash;and often
would the aged women observe to each other,&mdash;as
they passed him by to work in the fields, and remembered
Tom Cussitt's prophecy, to which Davy's father
would so often recur in his neighbours' hearing,&mdash;"So
much for the man who hath brought his ninepence
to nought!"</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND THE FIDDLER;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"DON'T SAY SO TILL YOU ARE SURE."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is a long day since Zed Marrowby and Phil Garrett
passed quietly away from this wilderness of confusion
and wrong, and their names are well-nigh
forgotten. But they were, each of them, so unlike
other folk in their way of life, and in their old-fashioned
habits of thinking and talking, that there
is no wonder they have slipped out of the world's
memory as well as out of the world itself. Two odd
old fellows they were deemed for many a year, albeit
there are few happier old fellows, upon the whole,
than they were. And who were they?</p>

<p>Zed was an humble fishermen on the Trent, and
never knew what it was to be possessed, at once, of
twenty shillings in his life. His father was called
Zedekiah, but the son never reached that long-name
dignity. Zed was taught the art and mystery of
fishing with an angle, fishing with set lines and hooks,
fishing with nets&mdash;in brief, all kinds of fresh-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
fishing, when a boy, by his father,&mdash;whose father and
grandfather before him were each and all fishermen.
Zed was a bachelor all his life long, and that means
fourscore and five; and Zed never had but one bosom-friend,
and that was blind Phil Garrett the fiddler.</p>

<p>Phil could not trace his ancestry in an uninterrupted
line for several generations like his friend Zed.
In fact, it may seem strange to a world so wise as the
world is now-a-days, but Phil Garrett never knew
who was his own father! His earliest recollections
were of hard usage by all around him save his mother,
who herself died of hard usage, and left him to the
ruthless world, a blind orphan at a tender age. There
was as great doubt about Phil's true Christian name as
there was about his parentage: some said it was
Philip, and others said it ought to be Philander;
here and there one contended it must be Philibert,
while his godmother, Abigail, inclined to believe it
was Philemon, but even she could not justly remember&mdash;for,
as she used to say, "the parson quite
took away her recollection of it, by hemming and
hawing, and being so long about the trifling matter
of sprinking the child&mdash;and all the while she was
pretty sartain the christening-cake would be burnt
under the wood-ashes, for she made it herself, and
placed it under the dish at the last moment, in order
that it might not be spoilt while they were at church."
However, Phil contrived to teach himself to play on
the fiddle when a boy, and thereby managed to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
his own living, without ever seeing the sun, or knowing
exactly, either his own name, or the name of his
father.</p>

<p>Zed and Phil were nearly of an age, and became
attached to each other when they were in their teens:
indeed, from that period of life they were inseparable,
except on special occasions. It was a singular companionship,
was that of Zed Marrowby, the fisherman,
and blind Phil Garrett, the fiddler. As soon as day
broke, through spring, summer, and autumn, Zed
might be seen wending his way among the osiers, on
the banks of old Trent, towards his small narrow
boat; and blind Phil, with his fiddle-case under his
arm, might be seen leaning on Zed's left shoulder, and
hurrying along with him. No matter how heavily it
rained, or strongly it blew, the two happy old
fellows were as constant in their time of rising, and
of their embarkation, as the sun was in mounting
above the east, unless Phil happened to be engaged
for a wedding or a wake, for the blind fiddler was in
high request for all the rustic rejoicings around
Torksey, where the singular companions lived&mdash;I
mean, at Marton, and Sturton, and Fenton, and Newton,
on the Lincolnshire side of the Trent; and not less
at Laneham, and Dunham, and Drayton, and Rampton,
and Leverton, on the side of merry Nottinghamshire.</p>

<p>Winter, you would say, would be but a dreary
season for the two old cronies, since it would put a
stop to their voyaging, and, by confining them within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
doors, would make them impish and melancholy.
But you are wrong, if you say so. There were nets
and lines to make and to mend, and the past to
recount, and the future to reckon upon; and Phil would
play on his fiddle while Zed would sing, and when
Phil's arm was weary with scraping, and Zed's throat
was sore with piping, Zed would listen till he fell
asleep with Phil telling ghost-stories and fairy-tales,
and love-ditties and robber-ventures,&mdash;all of which he
had learned from his godmother, old Abigail Cullsimple,
at once the most famous herb-woman, midwife,
and tale-teller, in her own day and generation, for
threescore miles round about ancient Torksey on the
Trent,&mdash;nay, it were perilous to assert that she ever
had an equal, in these three combined qualifications,
throughout the whole region of Lindsey.</p>

<p>It would take some thousands of pages to narrate
half the adventures in rain and fair weather, of the
fisherman and fiddler, during their threescore years of
friendship. Let it suffice to take up their life-story
for some two or three days of the last summer they
spent together in this world, commencing with a
fine morning in which they unmoored their little boat
somewhat earlier than usual, in order to reach Littleborough
for a wedding, before the turn of the tide.
The morning was such a delicious one, that, old as
they were, the two old voyagers could not restrain their
feeling of pleasure at the balmy and refreshing effect
it had upon their weather-beaten frames; and, blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
as poor Phil was, you could not have failed, had you
seen his expressive face when under very pleasurable
emotion, to discern that it scarcely needs the language
of eyes to demonstrate the heart's happiness. Their
little skiff darted like a fowl along the stream, so
finely did opening nature seem to nerve the old men's
arms, and puff their little sail; the very fishes seemed
scarcely to have time to take alarm while the oars
plashed amid the liquid silver, but darted and gambolled
after each other,&mdash;the rapid dace and the
delicate bleak, and the golden-finned perch,&mdash;every
moment to the surface of the stream, exulting, as it
seemed, in the solar glory. It was a morning to fill with
music every human soul that has any music in itself.
The sweet matin lute of the lark thrilled through the
heavens, and the still sweeter voice of the blythe milk-maid,
as she tripped it, fresh and rosy, over the lea,
was heard waking the echoes with her plaintive love-melody.
Zed and Phil were too true children of
Nature to disobey her influences, and thus chanted
their hearts' sedate joy, as they bent at the oar:&mdash;</p>

<p>Again and again they doubled the last verse, those
brave old voyagers! until many a milk-maid came up
the banks of Trent, leaving her cows on the lea, to
listen more nearly to the merry song they had so often
heard before from the two quaint companions of the
fishing-boat.</p>

<p>The little ferry of Littleborough was at length
gained, and Zed leaped as gaily on shore as if he
were yet in his youth, and then handed Phil out,
with his fiddle-case under his arm; and when the
skiff was moored, away they hasted to the "Ferry
Boat Inn," as the humble public-house was loftily
termed, and where the intended wedding and merry-making
was about to be held. After half-a-dozen
hearty gripes of the hand, and as many congratulations
on their good looks, the two old men were zealously
pressed to "eat and drink, and not spare,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
by the bluff landlord. And, nothing loth, Zed and
Phil sat down on the long-settle, and made free with
a good hearty beef-steak pie, and a tankard of ale;
and the landlord was ready to fill again ere the latter
was fairly empty. "Don't ye be dainty about it, my
hearties," said he, "for the youngsters will be down-stairs
soon; they've been dressing this I don't know
how long; and you'll ha' plenty to do, I warrant ye,
when they happen to find that you're come: so do
justice to your fare!"</p>

<p>And anon the bride that was to be was brought
down-stairs by a crowd of laughing lasses, and, blushing
like the May, was placed in a chair adorned with
flowers; and soon the lads burst in with the bridegroom,
all in best array of plush and velveteen; and
when he stepped up to the chaired beauty for a morning's
buss, the lads pulled him away and said "nay;"
and then all clapped their hands with delight when
they first saw Zed and Phil in the corner, and all
shouted, as if they were mad, for a good thumping
ditty that would put mettle in their heels. So Phil
struck up first "Malbrook's gone to battle," and then
"Gee-ho, Dobbin," and then "Grist the Miller,"
and then "She will and she won't," and then,
"Nelly is gone to be married;" and each lad took
his lass, and led up or followed the dance to the capers
of Phil's bow, till "The parson's come!" resounded
through the kitchen; and the marriage-procession
was immediately formed, and the kitchen was deserted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
for even Zed and Phil went off, the one
to see, and the other to hear, lovely Polly of the
Ferry-Boat Inn given away to sprightly and honest
young farmer Brown that morning, at the neighbouring
parish church of Sturton-le-Steeple.</p>

<p>The ceremony over, and the kitchen regained, feasting,
fun, and frolic, were the order of the day. Phil's
fiddle and Zed's throat were worked till the owners of
them could scarcely work longer; and oh, the tales
that Phil told, and the songs that Zed sung, in the
course of that merry wedding-day! why, the like of
'em could not be said or sung by man or maid, wife
or widow, within all Christendom!</p>

<p>Don't imagine, either, that the fun and frolic were
partaken of merely by the younkers: let me tell you,
that even the fat landlord himself, although verging
on fourscore, caught so much of the spirit of the
time, that he jumped up, all of a sudden, after watching
the nodding head and smirking face of Dame
Dinah Brown, the grandmother of the bridegroom,
and discerning how she began to fidget, like himself,&mdash;I
say he jumped up all of a sudden, and, seizing
her hand, whirled her away, not in the least unwilling,
to show the young lads and lasses that they
had not forgotten a quick step, and all that, as old as
they were. And, by Jingo! how all-alive did Phil
look, while he screwed up his catgut for a new
strain; and never was any thing seen in mortal man
more wonderful than the ecstatic changes of his blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
face, while he struck up "Green leaves all grow sere!"
as an accompaniment to the frisking feet of Dame
Dinah and the fat old landlord. And then he changed
the strain for one of rich merriment, while his sightless
and strangely expressive countenance depicted
every shade of wild and wilder glee, and vibrated
throughout its whole surface with every thrill of the
melody and gambol of the bow; insomuch that more
than one youth forgot every thing around, and stood
gazing at Phil's face, thinking they would never
forget how it looked, if they lived even to be as old
as Methusaleh.</p>

<p>On and on the aged dancers skipped, and "crossed"
and "set," looking as gleeful as if they had never
known what it was to be grave, until, streaming
with sweat, and fairly wearied out with the mad employment
they had been giving their heels, and to
which they had been strangers for many a long year,
they were constrained to sit down, avowing, meanwhile,
that "they only wished they were young
again, for then they would show the youngsters
what a bit o' dancing was in their time!"</p>

<p>When the sun had set, Zed began to feel some
degree of uneasiness to be gone. There was the
Trent to voyage, for at least three miles, in order
to reach their home at Torksey, and Zed knew the
stream would be somewhat swollen, but much more
he feared the state of his own upper story, since he
had not been able to resist the pressing invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and challenges, first of one and then of another, and,
consequently, his potations had been somewhat numerous.
Having given Phil the hint, Phil began
to complain of exhaustion as to his tale-budget, and
of the power of his nerves to direct the bow; but it
was long ere this would avail, and many a roaring
ditty was launched forth from the thunder of Phil's
catgut, amid the thundering heels of the country
lads and lasses, before the two aged cronies could
manage to obtain leave, once more, to launch their
little boat, and strike off for home. The farewell
chords were at last struck, the fiddle was boxed;
and, accompanied to the water's edge by a merry
company, Zed and Phil pushed off from shore amidst
the hearty cheers of the merry-makers. Then, each
taking his oar, as usual, away they went with the
tide, that now swept up the river's course.</p>

<p>Much as they had sung that merry day, the two
brave old fellows, nevertheless, trolled forth more
than one ditty before they reached Torksey; and
neither of them suffered any depression of spirits or
strength as they prosecuted their homeward voyage.
Zed Marrowby, especially&mdash;and, in good faith his
alacrity must be fairly confessed to have owed its
greater intensity to his most frequent potations&mdash;Zed,
especially, sprung on shore with the nimbleness of a
lad of twenty, as soon as they arrived in front of the
ruins of old Torksey castle, which stands like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
blighted, and yet beautiful thing of the past, beside
the very brink of the noble stream.</p>

<p>"As sure as a gun, Phil," cried the mellow old
fellow, stamping with vehemence, as he was leading
Phil under a propped fragment of the old fabric,
"we'll not go to bed to-night till we've seen whether
there be any gold in these vaults, as the story goes!
I've heard you tell the tale about folks hiding their
coin here, in the time of bloody Oliver, until my
patience is worn out. I'm determined, Phil, to
know whether any money can be found here, or not!"</p>

<p>"Why, zowks, Zed!" exclaimed Phil Garrett,
"you're not so mad with that glass o' rum they gave
you before you pushed off as to have taken it into
your head to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't bother me, Phil!" said the fisherman in a
pet, "I'm determined to fish up the gold out of
these old vaults before midnight, as late as it is, and
that's the long and short on't!"</p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" cried Phil, uttering
an old saying that he was very fond of; "how will
you dig up the gold, Zed? you have never a shovel
nor a pick-axe, you know."</p>

<p>"Then I'll soon have both," replied Zed; "you
sit down here on this stone, Phil, and I'll go and
slive into the Talbot yard, and I'll warrant it I'll
soon have a pick-axe and a shovel." And off Zed
scampered as fast as his old heels, impelled by his
heated head, could carry him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"Bring the dark lanthorn with you!" cried Phil,
shouting after him as loudly as he dared to shout;
and then, sitting down on the grass in lieu of the
hard stone, began to think of the oddness and suddenness
of Zed's resolution. "What a fool Zed
always becomes when he gets a drop of rum!" thought
Phil to himself; "and, confound it! I feel queerish,
somehow, myself. I wish I had not drunk that tipler
o'rum. It was very foolish of me, for I always tell
Zed to stick to good old Sir John Barleycorn, and
then no great harm can come on it. But what's the
use of grumbling and growling at one's self when it's
done? I'll e'en make the best on't, since it is so."
And Phil was about to troll forth another merry
ditty, when he remembered that it was near midnight,
that it must be thereabouts pitch dark, and
that he was among the ruins of Torksey Castle,
where, according to a queer skin-freezing story he
was wont to tell himself, the lady without the head
was often seen to walk at midnight! So Phil, too
muddled to remember that he could not have seen
the headless lady if she had appeared, held his peace,
and thought it was better to keep quiet in such a
queer place and at such a queer time of night.</p>

<p>Phil had not long to wait for the return of his
eccentric companion. Zed soon was at Phil's side,
and, grasping his hand, assured him they would soon
be as rich as Jews with the buried gold.</p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" again cried Phil:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
but Zed took no notice of it, and upheaving the pick-axe,
without spending a moment in considering
whereabouts he ought to begin, struck at the ground
with all his might, assisted, not a little, at the first,
by his invisible but potent friend, Dr. Alcohol.</p>

<p>"Have you begun so soon, Zed?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure," replied Zed, "I'm in earnest,
man, and mean to have this gold, depend on't."</p>

<p>"I'faith, it seems as though you did," returned
Phil, feeling disposed to roast his old friend, as they
say; "do you find aught yet?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" answered Zed, "let me get another foot
or so deeper, and then ask me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm in no hurry," said Phil; "only I thought
I might as well be knowing. But are you tired so
soon, Zed?"</p>

<p>"I'm only just resting a moment," replied Zed;
but he was up, and was working away again with
the pick-axe the next minute. Then he took the
shovel and began to clear away the loose earth, so as
to be able to see, by the light of the lanthorn, how
deeply he had penetrated the ground.</p>

<p>"Do you see aught yet?" asked Phil with a
slight titter which he suppressed as well as he could.</p>

<p>"Don't be in such a confounded hurry! I didn't
think a bit o'gold would ha' made you so covetous to
get at it!" answered Zed, throwing down the pick-axe,
and pretending to be in a pet, though, in reality,
it was the tremendous ache in his back that caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
him to throw down an instrument of labour to which
his aged hands were quite unused.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, I tell you, I'm in no hurry at all,"
again retorted Phil; "only, as I said before, I
thought I might as well be knowing."</p>

<p>"All right, Phil!" cried Zed, in a twinkling of
time, "here goes again!" and struck more savagely
at the ground this time than ever; for, in spite of his
affected coolness, the old fisherman began to feel very
impatient. In the course of a very few minutes,
however, Zed was again unable, from sheer weariness,
to proceed, and, although he changed his implement
again for the spade, yet his back ached too violently
for him to go on with his gold-finding, so he sat
down once more to rest, and wiped the streaming
perspiration from his aged face with a hand that
trembled, as indeed he trembled all over, like an aspen
leaf.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" cried Phil, "how you puff and
blow, Zed! Do you begin to feel ill with your hard
work?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! how old-womanish you talk!" retorted
the fisherman, and started up again, like a young
blood of four-and-twenty. But, somehow or other,
Zed found it quite impossible to get on, the ache in
his old back was so violent.</p>

<p>"I say, Phil," he said, pausing suddenly, and looking
very cunning at the fiddler,&mdash;though the fiddler
could not see either the sly wink of his eye or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
other of the signs by which the old fisherman intended
it to be understood that a very shrewd thought had
struck him,&mdash;"I say, Phil, what d'ye suppose I'm
just now thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell exactly," replied Phil, though he had
a somewhat knowing idea of what was coming, for
all that.</p>

<p>"Why, I was thinking&mdash;&mdash;Oh!" said the poor
old fisherman, feeling a twinge in his back so dreadfully
excruciating that it forced him to cry out before
he was aware&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! have you found the gold?" asked Phil,
bursting into a titter; "have you found it, Zed?"</p>

<p>"Found the devil!" exclaimed Zed, growing really
ill-tempered at being thus coolly roasted by his old
companion.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, take care, Zed; or we <i>may</i>
find him, with a witness, in this queer place, and at
this queer time o'night!" rejoined the fiddler; "but
what may you be thinking about, after all, Zed?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was thinking we might cover up this
hole, so that no notice would be taken of it, and then
come and finish the job another time," replied Zed,
who felt so much ashamed of what pain compelled
him to say, that he could with difficulty get through
his speech.</p>

<p>"Come, now, sit you down a bit, Zed," said Phil,
in a tone of hearty kindness, that always came over
Zed's more boisterous nature with the power of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
sweet lull after a squall,&mdash;"sit you down a bit, and
let's have a bit o'talk, while you rest yourself, for
I'm sure your old bones must ache with pain and
weariness. Now, I say, Zed, just tell me, will you,
what would you do with this gold if you found it?"</p>

<p>"Do with it!" exclaimed Zed, staring at the fiddler,
though the fiddler could not stare at him; "what
would I do with it, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Ay, what would you do with it? Are you
tired of the old boat, after we've cruised in her so
many long years?"</p>

<p>"Tired of her! God forbid!" answered Zed, with
warmth rendered ludicrous by his insobriety; "no,
Phil! you and I will never forsake the old boat until
our own poor old timbers fall fairly in pieces!"</p>

<p>"I thought you could not be thinking about that,"
said Phil; "but what, then, I say, Zed,&mdash;what
could you contrive to do with this gold, if you found
it?"</p>

<p>"We could comfort the hearts of poor Dick Toller's
motherless and fatherless children, and poor Bob
Wilson's and Joe Martin's widows with it, you know,
Phil," answered the old fisherman.</p>

<p>"God bless your old heart, Zed!" cried Phil,
grasping his old comrade's hand, while his voice
faltered with deep emotion, "that's spoken just like
you! But I tell you, Zed, it is but a wild scheme to
be killing yourself with trying to find this gold."</p>

<p>"To speak truth," said Zed, interrupting the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
"I begin to think so, too: only, you see, Phil, this
old head o'mine always turns so wild when I happen
to be such a fool as to take rum when they offer it
me. As you always say, Phil, if one could but have
the resolution to stick to Sir John Barleycorn instead
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, Zed, say no more about it," said
Phil, remembering that the transgression was not
entirely confined to his friend; "shovel in the moulds
as soon as you can, and let us be making our way
home, for yon's twelve by the church clock, and we
mustn't be after sunrise, you know, to-morrow;
'twill be bad luck if we be, depend on't."</p>

<p>So Zed shovelled in the earth as fast as his aches
and pains would permit him; and at length Phil
threw the pick-axe over his shoulder, and Zed bearing
the fiddle-box, and shovel, and lanthorn, without
spending more time in talking, they hied them home
as nimbly as they could, dropping the pick-axe and
shovel over the Talbot yard wall as they went by,
and speedily throwing themselves on their joint bed,
when they had reached it, fell asleep almost in a
moment.</p>

<p>Before the sun arose, however, they were up and
in the open air; but Zed groaned heavily, more than
once, as they went along towards the Trent bank,
for his aged bones were very stiff at the joints, as he
said, and he often called himself a fool, inwardly, as
he thought of his wild, money-digging freak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
preceding night. His melancholy, however, was but
transitory. The merry-hearted old men were soon
on their favourite element; the sun began to throw
its cheering beams once more upon the rippling
waters; and, as the willows on the banks of the noble
Trent waved in the gentle breeze, and the rich
meadows on the border of the river sent forth their
reviving fragrance, Zed lifted up his head, while his
hand plied the oar, and in the fulness of a happy
heart thus opened the conversation for the day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't change places with the king
on his throne, Phil; I don't believe there's a happier
pair than you and I, Phil, in the wide world.
And yet, now, as wild a scheme as that was of mine
last night, I cannot help wishing, this morning, that
we had some o' that gold at this moment. I could
like to try my hand, Phil, as old and inexperienced
as it is in such work, at making some part of the
world happier."</p>

<p>"And so could I, Zed," said Phil; "and now
don't you think that my godmother's grandfather's
plan of dividing the land would be a good one, and
tend to make the world happier, if it were carried
into effect?"</p>

<p>"The deuce is in you, Phil, for always bringing
up that plan of your godmother's grandfather!" said
old Zed; "why, the plan may be good enough,
Phil; but how can it be brought about?"</p>

<p>"How can you get the gold?" retorted Phil.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" said Zed, with a hearty laugh; "i'faith,
Phil, one scheme is as likely to be brought about as
the other: but, take hold of that end o' the net,
Phil, for I see a famous pike or two, darting about;
and, you know, we must try to get something
to-day."</p>

<p>The net was thrown out, but failed; and, what
was most unusual, the labour of Zed and Phil was
continued for several hours without the capture even
of a solitary eel. Phil often thought Zed threw out
the net very wildly, and imagined the liquor he took
at the wedding had not yet spent its effects on him;
but the blind man could not be sure, for Zed seemed
resolutely taciturn.</p>

<p>'Twas about ten in the forenoon that Phil felt the
little boat was "brought up,"&mdash;he thought in an
inlet, or small creek, on the Lindsey side of the
Trent, after they had laboured with nets and lines
ever since a little after sunrise, and all without a
single instance of success.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Phil, d'ye know why I've pulled in here this
morning?" said Zed, as he was mooring the skiff.</p>

<p>"No, by'r leddy!" answered the old-fashioned
fiddler, "I can't tell, for the life of me! but it seems
to me that you've pulled in at Burton Folly,&mdash;have
you not, Zed? and what's the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>"Look sharp, Phil!" said Zed, briskly helping
Phil out of the boat, "we've had hard luck in the
water this morning, but we'll try our luck on land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
for once: we'll have one or two of 'Squire Hutton's
pheasants before we leave the holt."</p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" said Phil, for that
was a common saying with him, as I hinted before;
"I wish I could <i>look sharp</i>, as you bid me, Zed,&mdash;for
I'll be hanged if you are not tearing my poor
legs among the whins, like old pork, as the saying
goes."</p>

<p>"The deuce I am!" exclaimed Zed, slackening his
pace; "I wouldn't hurt you, for all the world, Phil:
but you know it's worth while trying to catch a
pheasant or two,&mdash;they're such fine game."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Zed," rejoined Phil, "whether it
be worth while or not: we may get into a scrape by
it, as old as we are, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" cried Zed, with an air of resolute
contempt; "come along, Phil!&mdash;come along!"</p>

<p>"O come along, ay!" said Phil; "I shall go
with you, if you go to the very devil!&mdash;but then I
don't see what's the use of going there, yet,&mdash;as old
'Squire Pimpleface used to say, when he gave up
playing cards at Saturday midnight, and refused, ever
after to play on Sunday mornings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Zed, stopping short,&mdash;"my eyes!
why, that must be the gamekeeper! No, it isn't:&mdash;but
we had better lie down, Phil."</p>

<p>"Down be it then!" said Phil, prostrating himself
among the long grass, while the old fisherman followed
his example.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, tell me," continued the fiddler, in a whisper,
as they lay along among the grass, and the fisherman
was anxiously keeping the look-out,&mdash;"tell me how
you intend to catch the pheasants, Zed: you know
you've no gun; and you can't catch 'em with a net in
open day,&mdash;besides you haven't brought the net out
of the boat, have you?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" replied Zed, "why, I've heard my father
say that 'Squire Hutton's pheasants used to be as
tame as bantam cocks, even in his time. We may
catch 'em, bless your soul! ay, easily! And, if
not, I'm sure I could hit one and knock it down with
my hat."</p>

<p>The blind fiddler burst into an uncontrollable fit of
laughter on hearing this artless declaration from his
ancient companion.</p>

<p>"Zowks, Zed!" he exclaimed at last, "thou hast
got some wild maggots, for sure, into thy head this
morning! prythee look out again, and see if the
coast be clear; for the sooner we shove off in the
boat again the better, I'm very sartain."</p>

<p>"Confound that fellow! he's coming this way,"
said Zed, in a voice of alarm. And, indeed, there
now seemed to be cause for fear, seeing that a tall man,
with a gun on his shoulder, was hastening down the
hill, apparently in a direction towards the foolish
hiding-place of the fiddler and the fisherman.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Phil?" asked Zed, in the
next breath.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"Cut and run!" cried Phil, and sprung up as
nimbly as a hare when you stumble upon her seat.</p>

<p>"Come along, then!" said Zed; and, seizing his
blind companion by the hand, away they galloped,
as fast as their old limbs would wag down the declivity,
to the boat.</p>

<p>Zed pushed Phil, head over heels, into the skiff,
and, jumping in himself, scudded away out of the
creek as fast as he could possibly "scull," or turn
the oar, at the boat's stern, after the manner of a
screw, in the water. The gamekeeper came up the
water-side, and approached within a few yards of the
boat, before the adventurers could make their way
back into the broad Trent.</p>

<p>"You are two very old men," said he, lifting up
his hand in a warning manner, "or I would certainly
detain you, and have you indicted for trespass. Take
care you are never found here again!"</p>

<p>Neither of the old men made a word of reply; and
the gamekeeper walked away.</p>

<p>"Detained us!&mdash;would he?" said Zed, in a low,
but contemptuous tone, as soon as they had gained
the breadth of the river, and the gamekeeper was
sufficiently out of hearing,&mdash;"how could he have
done that, if he had tried, think you, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Never mind talking about that, Zed,&mdash;let us be
content with having got out of a scrape," answered
blind Phil: "but now tell me, Zed," he continued,
putting an oar on one side of the boat, and taking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
share of labour with as easy naturalness as if he had
possessed the most perfect eyesight,&mdash;"what it could
be that put such a wild notion into your head as to
lead you to think of catching a pheasant with your
hand, or of knocking it down with your hat:&mdash;why
didn't you take a bit o' salt to throw on its tail,
Zed?" concluded the fiddler, and burst into another
fit of helpless laughter.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;he!" said the fisherman, forcing a
faint laugh, to conceal his shame and vexation;&mdash;"never
mind,&mdash;never mind that, Phil!" he said,&mdash;"my
old head gets weak, or I might ha' been sure
it would be a fool's errand. Was not it a mighty
piece of impudence in that thief of a gamekeeper,
think you, to tell us he had a mind to indict us for
'trespass,' as the Jack-in-office called it?&mdash;what
harm could we do, Phil, by just trampling among
the grass for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"Poor folks are not allowed to tread upon rich
folks' land, you know, Zed, without their leave,"
said the fiddler.</p>

<p>"No; but isn't it hard that there should be such
a law, Phil?" said the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, Zed," replied Phil, "my godmother's
grandfather,&mdash;who, my godmother used to
tell me, was a famous scholar in his day,&mdash;used to say
that all the land belonged to every body, and that nobody
ought ever to have called an acre his own, in
particular. If that had been the case, you see, Zed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the gamekeeper could not have threatened to indict
you and me for trespass this morning."</p>

<p>"No more he could, Phil," rejoined Zed; "but,
then, if the land belonged to every body,&mdash;in such a
way that nobody could say an acre belonged to him,
only,&mdash;why, how would the land be ploughed and
the grain sown,&mdash;for you know the old saying,
Phil, 'What's every body's business is nobody's
business?'"</p>

<p>"My godmother's grandfather used to say that
people ought to join in companies to do it," replied
Phil: "it's a subject I am not master of to the extent
he was, by all account; but I feel sure of one
thing, Zed,&mdash;that the world could not have been
much worse divided than it is at present, since the
rich have so much land among them, and the poor
have none."</p>

<p>"You are right there, Phil, beyond a grain
o'doubt," rejoined Zed.</p>

<p>"And my godmother's grandfather used to say
besides," continued the fiddler, "that God Almighty
gave the world to every body, and that the rich had
stolen the poor's share of the land&mdash;for God Almighty
never left them destitute."</p>

<p>"Then, in that case, Phil," said the fisherman,
"there is a share, each, belonging to you and to me:
and then it seems doubly hard to be told, when your
own share has been stolen from you, that you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
be indicted for trespassing upon the land of one that
has more than his share&mdash;doesn't it, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Right, Zed, right!" returned Phil; "I'm pleased
to find you relish a bit of sensible talk, now and
then; and can you deny, now, that that plan of my
godmother's grandfather would be a real good one,
and tend to make every body happy. Place all the
folks in the world on a level, Zed,&mdash;and let every
man take his fair share in ploughing and tilling, you
know, Zed,&mdash;and then let every man share in cutting
the corn,&mdash;and all would have a fair title to
eat it. You must see this to be fair&mdash;quite fair,
Zed?"</p>

<p>"Fair enough, no doubt," replied the fisherman;
"but then, Phil,&mdash;as I always ask you, but you
never answer me,&mdash;how can you contrive to bring
all this about?"</p>

<p>"Nay, now, you don't argue fair!" answered
Phil; and it was the only answer he had, like many
more learned proposers of good theories.</p>

<p>"A plague on all such gibberish!" exclaimed Zed,
"we shall want but a small share of any thing long,
and if we don't get our fair six feet of land when we
have done sailing, why, we can rest very well in
Davy Jones's locker. Where's the use of bothering
our old brains with such crabbed matters?"</p>

<p>"Ods bobs and bodikins!" replied Phil, "but I
think you are about right, Zed: I must own it's only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
a simple sort of a thing for you and I to be troubling
our heads about great folks and their lands."</p>

<p>"I' faith, you talk sense, Phil!" said Zed; "confound
the great folks! let 'em take their land! We've
managed to push along through threescore summers
and more, and we can manage to get through, I think,
now. But, swape in, Phil! for we're just alongside
Littleborough again, and I'm so hungry that I feel
inclined to step on shore, and ask for a bite of the
wedding-cake this morning: I'll warrant 'em they'll
be keeping up the merriment yet."</p>

<p>"Promise me one thing, though, Zed," said Phil,&mdash;"that
you'll take no more rum, if they offer it you,
and that you won't stay longer than a couple of hours
or so."</p>

<p>"Don't think I shall play the fool twice over!"
retorted Zed; "I'll warrant it I'll come away as sober
as a judge this time, and take no more fool's tricks
into my head to-day."</p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" observed Phil, in
his usual sly way; but Zed did not answer, for they
were now at shore, and the fisherman had leaped out,
and was once more mooring the little boat.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to relate that Zed found it
impossible to keep his hasty promise of a very short
stay, seeing that the "Weddingers" were "keeping
it up" in true old-fashioned style, and Phil's fiddle
became, right soon, the very soul of their merriment.
Phil, however, had made his mind up, and succeeded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
though with great effort, in getting his old companion
once more fairly afloat and on the way home
about an hour before sunset. Although Zed had,
indeed, the virtue to refuse the parting cup of rum,
when it was offered, yet his old noddle was far from
being its own perfect master, by reason of his frequent
revisitations of the ale-pottle; and the first mile on
the water was all music of the most gleeful nature
with the old voyagers. "Indeed," as Phil himself
used to say, when talking about it, "we had each of
us whetted our whistles till will-ye, nil-ye, we must
pipe, and couldn't help it!" They were trolling forth,
for the last time, their old burthen of</p>

<div class="i2">We all shall live till we die!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="in0">when the report of a gun, and the sudden flight of
a drooping heron across the Trent, arrested their
music.</p>

<p>"By Jingo! she's a dead bird, in three minutes!"
exclaimed Zed; "mark how her right wing droops,
Phil!"</p>

<p>"I wish I could mark it," said Phil; "but you
always forget that my poor old eyes are blanks, when
you've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There she goes, plop among the osiers!" cried
Zed, in an ecstasy; "pull away to the larboard,
Phil. I'll have her in a twink."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" observed Phil,
but pulled away like a dragon in the direction recommended
by his companion, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Zed leaped out of the boat in a confounded hurry,
when he thought it was near enough for him to gain
the shore; but he leaped out too soon, for he fell flat
on his face among the "warp," as the mud of the
Trent is called in Lincolnshire, and floundered like a
flat fish when it has been left by the water in a
situation where it cannot get away.</p>

<p>"Holloa! what, in the name o' bad luck, are you
about?" cried Phil, hearing poor Zed make a mighty
scuffle among the mud.</p>

<p>Zed made no answer, but kept struggling on; for
the fact was, that he was so eager to secure the bird,
that he had succeeded in laying hold of one of its
legs, and, keeping hold, prevented himself from
rising. The heron and Zed made a desperate flapping
and floundering, insomuch that Phil roared out,
more than once,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What, in the name of heaven and earth, are you
about, I say, Zed?"</p>

<p>"Keep the boat in shore," cried Zed, with his
mouth half filled with mud; "I shall have her in
another minute."</p>

<p>"'Don't say so till you're sure!'" retorted Phil
again; and just then the sportsman who had shot
the heron jumped out of his boat on a firmer part of
the strand, and, running along the bank, arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the spot where Zed was struggling with the bird.
He struck off Zed's hold of the fowl with a slight
blow from his fowling-piece, and bore away the bird
in triumph. Zed slipped into the Trent, and went
souse over head, but rose instantly, and clambered
into the boat. He vented his disappointment and
vexation against the sportsman in no very gentle
terms, while the sportsman mocked him from the
bank; and, when the captor of the heron stepped
into his boat, Zed urged Phil to pull away, that they
might capsize the fellow, and give him a ducking, as
he said in his foolish haste. But Phil was always
Zed's better angel, though he was but a blind old
fiddler. "No, no, Zed," he cried, "you shall not
go that way. Let us make for home, that you may
get to the fire-side. I say you shall <i>not</i> go&mdash;and I
mean it, too."</p>

<p>Nobody in the world could control Zed Marrowby
but Phil Garret, when old Zed was in his fuddled
freaks; and even Phil could not always succeed; but
Zed's wet shirt helped to cool his choler in this
instance.</p>

<p>"To old Nick with the fellow, and his heron-sue!"
cried Zed, pulling in the same direction with Phil;
"I'll e'en let him take his live lumber: what good
will it do him?"</p>

<p>"Just as the fox said of the grapes, when he
couldn't reach 'em&mdash;'Hang 'em! they're as sour as
crabs!'" rejoined Phil; "but that was what I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to myself, when you were struggling so hard to get
the useless fowl; and what good would it have done
you, Zed?"</p>

<p>"Hang me, if I know, exactly!" replied Zed,
looking foolish, and wishing himself in a corner.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like to eat a heron-sue, for they're
as rank as stinking fish, I've heard say," continued
Phil; "and what else you would have done with it
I'm quite at a loss to guess: but never mind, Zed,
you've got a cooler, now,&mdash;and I think you won't
be so hot again for some time to come."</p>

<p>"Well, well, it's all in our lifetime," said Zed,
resolving to be cheerful; "only pull away, and let
us get to our own fire-side, that I may dry my old
skin, there's a jolly fellow!"</p>

<p>"So I will, Zed," replied Phil, and doubled the
force of his strokes at the oar; "but I hope you'll
promise me not to resume your gold-digging when
we land under the old castle-walls."</p>

<p>"I will, I will, Phil,&mdash;and so don't banter me
any more; I shall be a cooler man for some time to
come, after this, depend on't," answered Zed, with
his teeth chattering.</p>

<p>And Zed spoke as truly as ever a prophet spoke,
and much more truly than many; for, although he
got well warmed ere he went to bed, yet his participation
of so much extra liquor at the wedding, his
foolish freak at money-digging the preceding night,
and his cold bath to conclude, operating together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
upon his aged frame, produced rheumatic effects
which never left him.</p>

<p>Zed Marrowby and Phil Garrett left their voyaging
at the close of that summer. True, they made
all fit and industrious preparation for the next
spring; and Zed's heart was gleefully bent on resuming
their old cruises on their beloved Trent, and
in their beloved old boat; but Phil listened with a
foreboding heart to the deep cough which shook
Zed's old body through the winter, and often interrupted
his fervid utterances of what pleasure he expected
when summer should come again. And when
Zed Marrowby would exclaim, "We shall have
another merry summer's cruise yet, Phil!" Phil
Garret would answer with more solemnity, much
more, than was his wont to put on, "Don't say so
till you're are sure. I think, Zed, we shall cruise no
more in this world; and I hope our next port will
be in a better land." Zed poohed and pshawed, for
some time, at this "solemn way o' talking," as he
called it; but at length he began to feel that Phil
was right&mdash;he grew feebler as the spring drew
nearer, and when it came, feeling the expectation to
be vain of ever stepping again into the beloved old
boat, he took Phil's advice&mdash;for he said he always
thought it worth more than the parson's&mdash;and
strove to fix his mind on reaching the happy port in
the better land.</p>

<p>Zed Marrowby's end was calm and peaceful; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
so was that of Phil Garret, his faithful companion,
who was also laid under the green sod in old Torksey
churchyard within six months after. The memory
of their names and lives is well-nigh lost in the rural
locality where they lived; but there is not a saying
more common in old Lincolnshire to this day than
that quaint caution so often uttered by the blind
fiddler to his less grave comrade, "Don't say so till
you are sure!"</p>

<h2>MASTER ZERUBBABEL,<br />
<span class="small">THE ANTIQUARY;<br />
AND<br />
HOW HE FOUND OUT THE "NOOSE LARNING."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Antiquaries are scarce now-a-days. Don't mistake
me, reader; I know that there is an abundance
of writers on things which are ancient&mdash;ay, and
more, that certain pragmatical folk pretend now
to know more exactly how every thing went on two
thousand years ago, nay four thousand years ago,
than was known a few generations since by the first
scholars in Europe. But don't say I question the
likelihood of people knowing more about the ancients
the farther time removes us from them,&mdash;because
that would be literary heresy, and would bring
upon an unlucky wight the hot persecution of the
orthodox. But&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;Antiquaries are scarce
now-a-days. I mean, your real thorough-bred ones,
if I may say so&mdash;the fine old fellows who forgot their
breakfasts and dinners, walked out in their night-caps,
went to bed in their inexpressibles,&mdash;in brief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
did all manner of queer absent things by reason that
they were ever present, in mind, with the long bearded
Druids, or the starched Romans, or the waggish
Athenians, or the broth-supping Spartans, or some
other of the peoples who have been dead and buried
hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Talk of antiquaries!&mdash;where
are your lean, skeleton, paragons
of patience now, who can dwell seven years, with
ecstasy, on the contemplation of a nail proven to
have been attached to a horse-shoe of ten centuries
old,&mdash;or who will write you, fasting, twenty folio
sheets on the discovery of an urn of Roman coins,
or the opening of a British tumulus? The race is now
extinct: it has been driven out of existence by the
newer and more civilised race of the gentlemen antiquaries,&mdash;just
as the aborigines of New Holland and
North America are following where the Peruvians
have already gone, into the realm of nought, before
the European grasp-alls.</p>

<p>One of the latest existing specimens of the genuine
antiquary was to be found in the little county town
of Oakham, in little Rutland, some seventy years bygone.
Zerubbabel Dickinson was his name, and he
was proud of it;&mdash;and many an unwilling and loitering
urchin had he whipt through the nouns and verbs,
and the "Propria qu&#230; maribus," into the "As in
pr&#230;senti," in his time, for he kept the best school in
the town, during his best days;&mdash;and when his vigour
declined, and his eyes and ears grew somewhat dim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
he still continued to exert his skill and intelligence
in the induction of a more contracted number of
pupils into the porches of classic learning. But then
he no longer enjoyed the high gratification of being
addressed in his full, imposing name, alike by peasant,
tradesman, or gentleman: Zerubbabel sunk to "Hubby,"
as the fine old pedagogue's shoulders declined
in their stately height, and his slower sense rendered
it less certain that he heard distinctly every syllable
which was uttered by his acquaintances. Yet there
was no acidity of motive, no ill-naturedness, in
the use of this familiar abbreviation, for Hubby
Dickinson was as much beloved, if he were not quite
so stiffly respected, as "Master Zerubbabel" had
been. And that shows, almost beyond the necessity
of telling, that the fine old antiquary had contracted
no rust of the heart among the rusty coins he had
turned over so oft and so ecstatically; but, rather,
that his excellent nature had mellowed and become
more loveable with age, though it had shrunk from
its former somewhat pride-blown proportions.</p>

<p>Self-complacence Hubby Dickinson had felt, in his
day,&mdash;and he must have been a philosopher, indeed,
could he have utterly subdued such a feeling,&mdash;seeing
that his learning was esteemed, by gentle and
simple, a thing so ponderous and vast, that every
body wondered how Master Zerubbabel's brain could
hold it, or his shoulders bear the burthen of it. Certes,
there was not even a clergyman in the neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
despite his Oxford or Cambridge matriculation,
but what resorted to the humble abode of the great
antiquarian schoolmaster for the interpretation of
difficult Greek or Hebrew texts; not an ancient
will or parchment ever puzzled a Rutland lawyer,
but it was brought to Master Zerubbabel Dickinson
to decipher it; and not a ploughboy or a hedger
or ditcher found a rust-eaten coin, or an ancient key,
or a mysterious-looking fragment of pottery beneath
the earth's surface, but they would forthwith journey
to the dwelling of the "high-larnt" Oakham schoolmaster
to learn the meaning, or the use, or the value
of their discovery. Coins the illustrious Zerubbabel
possessed of all ages, and almost all countries&mdash;at
least, so he believed,&mdash;and keys of the most ornate
Saxon fashion; and spear-heads and arrow-heads of
the most primitive Keltic rudeness; beaking-bills of
the age of Alfred, and daggers of the reign of Canute;
fragments of steel-shirts that had been worn in
the Crusades; and hilts and crosses of swords which
had done service in Cressy or Agincourt: and all
these were so learnedly arranged, that their order,
itself, proclaimed the antiquary's incomparable erudition;
while the syllables he would utter in illustration
of their uses, and ages, and owners, and concomitants
innumerable, left you in a perfect whirl of wonder!</p>

<p>Now, of all these, the priceless contents of his
precious museum, Zerubbabel had written folio upon
folio; and still continued to write thereon, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
that it behoved him to say all that possibly could be
said, on topics of such surpassing magnitude and importance,
ere he ventured to give his lucubrations to
the world. Nevertheless, these were minor labours,
which, compared with one great and grand undertaking
that occupied nine-tenths of every leisure
hour of his more advanced life, were but as so many
ant-hills to a pyramid.</p>

<p>Reader, hast thou ever seen the old castle of Oakham?
If thou hast not, and opportunity will serve,
prythee, go thither, and feast thy eyes with the
wondrous array&mdash;not of breathing sculptures, or
matchless pictures; not of antique folios or curiously
carven cabinets; not of storied tapestries or blazing
heraldries&mdash;but of horse-shoes: ay, horse-shoes of
all sorts and sizes, that adorn the walls of that singular
old Saxon hall,&mdash;supported by its "antique pillars
massy proof,"&mdash;and stretching its primitive roof overhead.
A sight it is, pregnant with abundant reflection,
that curious monument of feudalism; and
many and marvellous are the stories they tell you
about its origin: but, chiefly, they report that Ferrers&mdash;the
Earl now, but simply, the <i>ferrier</i>, or farrier,
to the victorious Norman&mdash;obtained, with this fief,
authority to demand a horse-shoe of any knight,
baron, or earl, who rode for the first time through
his manor of Oakham. And many a veritable shoe
taken from the foot of the steed of proud baron, or
chivalrous knight,&mdash;his name obliterated by the rust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of ages,&mdash;you behold on those walls; but therewith
now mingle the mock-shoes of the modern great:
a semblance, merely, put up at a great price, in some
instances, they say. Gigantic shapes, some of these
modern things are: such are those bearing the inscriptions
"H. R. H. the Prince Regent," and
"H. R. H. the Duchess of Kent," which latter hath
a more diminutive one beside it, inscribed "the
Princess Victoria." Of the judges, who here hold
the courts of assize, the modern monuments of this
curious kind are the most numerous; and if you listen
to a sly Oakhamer he will not fail to tell you how
often that model of political consistency, of generosity,
liberality, integrity, impartiality, gentleness, and all
the enlightened virtues&mdash;the ever-to-be-commemorated
Abinger&mdash;was <i>dunned</i> for his five pounds, and
how often he contrived to slip, like an eel, through
the fingers of those whose office or privilege it is to
claim the shoe or the price of it, before he was
finally caught. Yet <i>there is</i> the shoe of the stainless
and exalted legal functionary on the wall,&mdash;so that
he <i>was</i> caught at last!</p>

<p>Pardon, reader, this most unseemly wandering
from the illustrious subject of our present biography,
the erudite Zerubbabel Dickinson. Now it was
in the contemplation of this unique monument of
baronial greatness,&mdash;it was in the collection and
collocation of manuscripts relative to the identity of
the several shoes,&mdash;it was in the array of the pedigrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of those in whose names they were put up,&mdash;it
was in brushing away the rust (not from the shoes,
for the discerning Dickinson would have adjudged
him a pagan, of a verity, and no Christian, who dared
to disturb a grain of it!)&mdash;the rust of uncertainty
that hung about the names and memories of those to
whom the more ancient furniture of horses' feet belonged,&mdash;it
was in this mine profound of all that was
important, and noble, and useful, and great, and
grand, about the countless catalogue of horse-shoes
that were nailed to the walls of the great hall in the
castle of Oakham, that the learned and laborious
Zerubbabel dug and delved,&mdash;it was on these themes,
I say (and I scarcely know how to express myself
worthily on so magnitudinous a matter), that the
indefatigable and magnanimous schoolmaster-antiquary
expended the choicest energies of his untiring
intellect.</p>

<p>This, courteous reader, was the prime labour&mdash;the
<i>opus majus</i> of Master Zerubbabel Dickinson.
The work was to have been entituled "<i>Tallagium
illustrissimum; seu Catalogus solearum ferrearum</i>"&mdash;with
I know not how many more <i>ums</i> and <i>arums</i>,
besides. <i>Was</i> to have been? Yes; for let it not be
supposed that so stupendous a work was ever finished.
It was the opinion of the laborious Zerubbabel himself
that it never could be finished, so transcendent
was the <i>beau-id&#233;al</i> of such a work that he had conceived.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>But enough of a subject which, in this degenerate
age, will never be placed at its right value. This
slender fragment of a biographic memorial was not
commenced so much with the view of showing how
truly great a man was the erudite Master Zerubbabel,&mdash;since
we would despair as deeply of doing justice
to so immense a subject as Zerubbabel himself despaired
of completing the leviathan folios of the mighty
"Tallagium illustrissimum:" we have a more philosophic
purpose in view&mdash;namely, the proof, by history,
of the striking moral truism, that the greatest men
are very little men when you take them out of their
accustomed sphere: in other words, that the wisest
men are fools when you talk to them about things
with which, in spite of their wisdom, they are not
conversant. But why prove a truism? Ah, my
friend, these same truisms, as the world calls them,
for the greater part, are just the very things that
want proving&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Master Hubby," said a jolly fat farmer who
called, with his fat wife and her egg-basket, at the
schoolmaster's door, towards five of the clock on a
market afternoon, "we've browt ye a queer, odd-fashionedish
sort on a thing, here, that we f'un i'th'
home clooas tuther day; can ye tell us what it is?"
and the farmer produced an ancient fragment of ironwork
of a crooked form, but so unlike any modern
utensil of any kind, that any one but an antiquary
might well be puzzled with it. Nay, the profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
erudite Zerubbabel himself was nonplused for the
moment! He turned it over and over, and put on
his spectacles, and then took them off again, and
wiped them, and re-adjusted them to the most perfect
distance for his natural optics&mdash;that is to say, he
placed them as near to the very tip of his nose as they
would remain without falling off,&mdash;but all his delays
for consideration would not do: he was compelled to
confess that he did not know what it was!</p>

<p>"Why dooant ye, indeed?" cried the farmer with
a stare.</p>

<p>"The Lord ha' marcy on us! you dooant say so,
Master Hubby, do ye?" echoed the farmer's wife,
perfectly electrified with the thought that there was
any thing ancient which Hubby did not understand;
and she set down her basket of eggs, and drew out
her spectacle-case, and put on her spectacles also, to
gaze at Hubby in his.</p>

<p>And so there stood the odd trio at the learned
schoolmaster's door: the man of ancient learning,
barnacled to the nose-tip, and holding up the curious
crooked rusty piece of iron with a gaze of indescribable
eagerness; and the farmer with open mouth, and
hands buried in the profound pockets of the plush
waistcoat that enveloped the goodly rotundity of his
person; and the farmer's wife, with the basket at
her feet, her arms a-kimbo, and her eyes directed
with intense earnestness through her spectacles on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the movements of the illustrious Zerubbabel's countenance.</p>

<p>There was a perfect silence of full three minutes,
and still the trio gazed on.</p>

<p>"Where found ye it?" asked Hubby, at last,
not knowing what other question to adventure.</p>

<p>"At Hambleton on th' hill," replied the farmer;
"and what think ye to't then now, Master Hubby?"
he asked again.</p>

<p>Zerubbabel shook his head, and there was again a
profound and perfect silence.</p>

<p>"You know, Davy," said the farmer's wife, at
length, "young Bob Rakeabout said he was somehow
of a mind it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh, woman!" said the impatient farmer;
"where's the use and sense of telling what such a
rattle-scallion as he thinks?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but, Davy," reiterated the spouse, "it may
be of use, for they say he's book-larnt."</p>

<p>"Book-larnt! ay, mally good faith, I think as
much: and noose-larnt, too," replied the farmer; "and
I wish, when his last noose is tied, he may be allowed
benefit o' clargy!" and he burst into a loud laugh at
his own wit.</p>

<p>"Well, howsomever," said the wife, "young Bob
said he could swear it was a spur, and nowt else."</p>

<p>"<i>Calcar equitis Romani</i>, of a verity!" exclaimed
Zerubbabel, and danced with ecstasy, till the farmer
and his wife stared harder than ever.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha! ye f'un' it out?" cried the farmer's wife:
"Lord! maister Hubby, do tell us what ye think
it is."</p>

<p>"A spur, good neighbours, a spur it is, no doubt,
and hath belonged to some valorous Roman knight
many ages ago," replied Hubby.</p>

<p>"Why, zowks, then, Bob was right," said the
farmer; "and pray ye, Maister Hubby, accept a
dozen o' pullets' eggs with it, for it is not worth
having by itself."</p>

<p>Zerubbabel was of a very different opinion, but
very thankfully received the eggs, notwithstanding;
and his homely visitors bade him good afternoon.</p>

<p>And now did the deeply learned man retire into
the very penetralia of reflection, and meditation, and
thought, and consideration, and so forth; yet the
"vasty cavern" of his mind displayed other and
more profound concernments than admiration of the
invaluable Roman spur. "<i>Noose-larnt</i>"&mdash;that was
the singular word which riveted his thought.
"Noose-larnt!"&mdash;what could it mean? That was
the great question which the great Zerubbabel
asked of himself&mdash;for he knew no higher authority
on such high matters&mdash;at least one hundred times
before he went to bed; but he slept&mdash;answerless!
Again, on the succeeding day&mdash;ay, and on the
day succeeding that day&mdash;Hubby Dickinson pondered
on the same profound problem; and, on the
third night, when he had extended his cogitations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the stroke of twelve, and his sole remaining candle
was reduced to one inch of tallow, and four of black
wick, curling through and through the struggling
bit of flame, and spreading gloom rather than light
over Hubby's little studium&mdash;then it was that
Hubby Dickinson, feeling one thought go through
him like a flash of lightning, suddenly sprang up,
crying out, "Eureka&mdash;eureka!" and plucked an
ancient volume from its shelf to satisfy himself of
the correctness of his thought.</p>

<p>The searcher for enlightenment snuffed the candle
with a speed and dexterity which few could equal,&mdash;performing
the act with Nature's snuffers, his
fingers,&mdash;feeling that the vastitude and urgency of
the inquiry did not permit the delay of employing
the aid of man's mechanic invention,&mdash;and then, and
then&mdash;opening the ancient volume, and turning to
the name he contemplated, and fixing his spectacles,
once again, in the most advantageous position&mdash;the
ardent and delighted antiquary read out aloud to
himself the following passage from the said ancient
tome:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anaxagoras, the disciple of Anaximenes, was surnamed
<i>Nous</i>, which signifieth <i>intelligence</i>, by reason
of his excelling quickness of parts, and a certain, I
know not what, of instant perception or discernment
of nice difficulties in a twinkling. For whereas
other wise men went round about to survey the
questions to them proponed, on this side and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and, after much nice calculation and naming of
postulates, drew from the balance of probabilities
what they affirmed to be a correct answer, this
philosopher manifested a strength and clearness of
judgment, and swiftness of reasoning, which might be
said to partake of intuition,&mdash;a faculty which the
gods themselves only possess in its perfection: and
thus it came to pass that Anaxagoras was called, in
the Hellenistic tongue, <i>Nous</i>, or intelligence."</p>

<p>That was the passage he read; and when he had
read it he closed the heavy quarto with a noise like
the report of a gun, and again cried out that "he had
found it" with all his power of lungs. And then,
feeling that he had done business enough for one
night, in having made so transcendentally-sagacious
a discovery, he put out the small remnant of candle,
groped his way to his bedside, and, while he performed
the prefatory work of unclothing, thus he
soliloquised:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yea, of a verity, this is the true interpretation
of the mystery. This 'Noose-larnt' young man is
some great natural genius,&mdash;some miracle of mother
wit,&mdash;some second Anacharis the Scythian, who
would very likely beat all the wise men of this time,
although he never entered the pale of the schools,&mdash;nay,
perhaps, hath never passed beyond the limits of
the lordship of Hambleton-on-the-hill. I have no
doubt of it; for none but such a genius could have
determined, without witchcraft, that this curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
shapen piece of ancient armour pertained to the
heel. It is strange that my friend, the parson of
Hambleton,&mdash;who must have given the young man
this expressive epithet, seeing that the rural people
understand no Greek,&mdash;it is strange that he never
told me of the existence of this youth. But I will
essay to find him out, if I be spared till the morning
light! O Hubby Dickinson! though few now
call you Zerubbabel, yet you may have lived to
this age for a high purpose, even to bring to
light the name and singular endowments of this
'Noose-larnt' youth! Why, the discovery may even
ennoble you beyond the composition of the grand
Tallagium!" And then Hubby fell asleep, and
dreamt delightfully; but the delight itself, of his
dream awoke him, and again he began to soliloquise
amid the darkness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it is as clear and luminous as the sun at
noon to my mind," he said to himself: "nothing
less than the possession of a high degree of the faculty
of intuition could have enabled this youth to announce
such a truth. Verily, there is no wonder
the rude peasant people entertain suspicions that he
hath a familiar, or is a wizard: and that they do
entertain such ideas is evident from that strange
exclamation, or rather optation, of Gaffer Davy&mdash;he
wished when the youth's last noose was tied he
might find benefit o'clergy. There, is an allusion to
the ancient privilege of escape from the halter by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
neck-verse, which I have illustrated in the Tallagium.
Doubtless, the farmers and ploughmen believe this
singular youth to be one who deals in the black art,
and think his mal-practices may bring him to the
gallows. Ah, it is the way in which the lights of
the world have been treated in all ages! I will find
out the abode of this miracle of nature, that I
will!" he said, and again fell asleep.</p>

<p>The morning broke, Hubby opened his eyes, and
forthwith arose to renew his self-congratulations.
"Ah, Hubby," said he to himself, "you will live to
be called Master Zerubbabel again, by gentle and
simple; for you are destined, this day, to achieve a
great work!" And then he went over the roll of
his reasonings again, and, feeling more assured than
ever of the certitude of them, he again congratulated
himself. "Ay, as old as I am, I have not lost my
power of penetrating a matter," he said; "tell me
who, in the whole county of Rutland, except myself,
could have found this out from the simple premises
on which it was given me to erect my sagacious
hypothesis?"</p>

<p>Reader,&mdash;was Hubby Dickinson a very silly old
fellow to talk and think thus? Ah, how many of
your great philosophers have reared their world-admired
hypotheses from premises as slight; and
yet how long it was before the folly of many of
them was found out!</p>

<p>Well, there was now but one step to be taken as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
a preliminary to the commencement of Hubby's
journey to Hambleton, which, he was sure, would
be memorable while the world lasted: it was&mdash;to
give his scholars a holiday.</p>

<p>Reader,&mdash;talk of potentates by whatever name
you will; but your schoolmaster is your only emperor!
Can he not make laws&mdash;break laws&mdash;bind
his subjects&mdash;set them free&mdash;and, in one word, do
what he listeth? I tell thee, reader, that his is the
true <i>imperium in imperio</i>: his will is law, and who
can gainsay it? Thou knowest of no potentate so
truly imperial as the village schoolmaster.</p>

<p>And Hubby Dickinson&mdash;had he not power in
himself, and of himself&mdash;to give his boys a holiday?
That he had; and when the word was given, ye
powers! what a rush was there over benches, and
what a scampering for hats; and then the huzza!
when the threshold was passed and the plans for
fun throughout the livelong day that were formed!
Woe worth the world! one owes it a grudge, one is
tempted to think, since it hath taken away from our
lips the nectared chalice of childhood, and giveth us
now, from day to day, no other draught but this
unsavoury minglement, wherein one scarcely knows
whether the bitterness or the insipidity most prevails!</p>

<p>It was but three short miles from Oakham to Hambleton;
and Hubby Dickinson's eagerness of desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
gave such strength and speed to his limbs that he
soon reached the village.</p>

<p>"Pray, my good friend," said he to a farmer on
horseback, as he entered the place, "can you say
where I shall find the singularly endowed youth who
is familiarly called Bob Rakeabout, the Noose-larnt?"</p>

<p>Poor Hubby! how he stared, and how loftily indignant
he felt, when the farmer returned him a
broad horse-laugh for an answer, and, setting spurs
to his horse, rode away! He was not to be driven
from his purpose, however, and put the same question
to a pedestrian, next. The man, who was a
ditcher with a shovel on his shoulder, touched, or
rather nipped, his hat skirts, and asked what the
gentleman said; and when he clearly understood that
Bob Rakeabout was wanted, his reply was, that he
knew not where he would be found, unless at the
alehouse. Hubby thanked his informant, but was
sure within himself that there was some mistake
arising from the man's dulness, for it could not be
that a genius of so magnificent a grade as the human
being he was seeking could be found loitering in a
vulgar alehouse. So on Hubby strode, looking at
the ground, and thinking, and thinking,&mdash;till, at
last, he was accosted by a very dark-visaged and
singularly dressed man, who stood by a tent in a
lane, on the other side of the village&mdash;for the thinker
had passed quite through it, unconsciously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine weather, sir," said the man; "you seem to
be in a brown study."</p>

<p>"Pray, my friend," said Hubby, instantly, "know
you one Bob Rakeabout, a singularly gifted youth
who, I am informed, hath obtained the significant
epithet of the 'Noose-larnt?'"</p>

<p>The man took his short black pipe from his mouth,
and stared agape for a few seconds, and then said,
with a smothered laugh,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob! Ay, I know him well: he's famous
for noose-larning!"</p>

<p>Hubby Dickinson's heart leaped within him, and he
bounded from the side of the road into the centre of
the lane, and, grasping the man's hand, conjured him
to lead him to the youth's presence. By this time,
three or four more dark faces had gathered at the
entrance of the tent.</p>

<p>"Come in a bit," said the man to whom the
antiquary had addressed himself. And, winking at
his companions, the gipsy led Hubby into the tent.</p>

<p>Hubby was placed upon a sack that covered a clump
of wood, and was invited to partake some bread and
cheese,&mdash;while a boy ran into the village to fetch
Bob Rakeabout. Having, in his eagerness, utterly
forgot his breakfast at home, Hubby felt nothing
loth when he saw the food, and accordingly accepted
a "good farrantly piece," as the gipsies called
it. A humming horn of ale followed, and then
another, and another. Indeed, the contents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
huge black earthen bottle were passed about rather
freely. Endless questions followed, and strange
answers were given; and sometimes the gipsies
stared, and at others they smiled, and often they
were in danger of laughing outright.</p>

<p>At length the boy returned, and, behold! immediately
afterwards Bob Rakeabout, the "Noose-larnt"
himself, entered the tent! Hubby rose to receive
him, bareheaded; but, he knew not how it was, it
was somewhat difficult for him to stand, and so he
sat down again. As for the great natural phenomenon
himself, he stretched his brawny hand to each of
the gipsies, and they shook it with remarkable good-humour.
Then, seizing the black earthen bottle, he
applied it to his mouth, without either using the horn
or waiting for invitation to drink.</p>

<p>Hubby's thinkings were becoming somewhat confused;
but he turned, inwardly, to the fact that
Diogenes threw away his dish when he saw the boy
drink out of his hand. "Of a verity, the youth is
one of Nature's own miracles!" said he to himself.</p>

<p>Forthwith, Bob Rakeabout rakishly laughed as he
took out a large pouch, composed of mole-skins, and
filled with tobacco. He laid it open on the floor of
the tent, filled his own short pipe from it, and the
gipsies immediately followed his example. Hubby,
as yet, had scarcely spoken to Bob; but when the
whole company began to smoke, and the antiquary
was again pressed to drink, for more than one reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
he quietly remarked that he much wished to converse
with this youth alone.</p>

<p>"Oh, ay," replied the gipsy, whom Hubby had
seen first, "Bob will have no objection to that:&mdash;you
can show this gentleman some noose-larning,
can't you, Bob?"</p>

<p>The gipsies tittered,&mdash;but Bob understood the
question,&mdash;for much had been said by himself and
the gipsies in the peculiar slang of their tribe, which
Hubby had not comprehended.</p>

<p>"Take another horn, sir," said Bob; "and give
us another ten minutes to smoke our pipes out, and
I'll show ye some noose-larning, in a twink."</p>

<p>Hubby's head swum partly with pleasure, but
much more with the strong ale, to which he was
unused; but he drank off the other horn, in eager
expectation of such a mental feast to follow it as he
had never yet tasted.</p>

<p>"Come along wi' me, sir!" cried Bob, springing
up, suddenly, at the end of less than ten minutes;
"come along wi' me, and I'll show ye some noose-larning!"</p>

<p>"Are ye really off, Bob?" asked the gipsies, all
together.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," he answered, "kick up a roaster, and
set on iron-jack against I come back."</p>

<p>Hubby thought this strange talk; but he had not
time to think much about it, for Bob seized him by
the hand, and away they scampered together over two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
or three fields, and then entered a wood. And here
Bob took from his pocket certain strange engines of
wood and wire, and, showing Hubby the noose attached
to each, planted them severally in little
openings of bush or brake, while Hubby stared like
one that was thunder-struck, for Bob only uttered
one word&mdash;"Noose-larning!" and then, seizing
Hubby by the arm, hurried him on again. At
length, in the thickest part of the wood, Bob began
to take up engines instead of putting them down&mdash;but,
lo! there were dead hares attached to them.</p>

<p>And now poor Hubby Dickinson saw of what kind
of mettle the "miracle of mother-wit" was made, and,
taking to his heels, he ran from the poacher with as
much haste as if a legion of fiends were behind him.
Did the poacher follow? Not he, indeed. He only
burst into hysterics of laughter, and then went on
with his business.</p>

<p>And whither fled the antiquary? Indeed, he knew
not; but, having emerged from the wood, he ran as
long as the fumes of the strong malt-liquor in his brains
permitted him to retain possession of the power of his
feet; and, when they failed him, he fell souse into a
ditch, which happened merely to contain mud instead
of water, and remained there, insensible and asleep
for the greater part of the time, till late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the parson of Hambleton,
who was an old antiquarian crony of Hubby's, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
his afternoon walk in that direction, and, to his perfect
amazement, found his erudite friend in the ditch.</p>

<p>"Noose-larning!" roared out Hubby, and shook
and shuddered, when the parson had poked him with
his walking-stick until he waked him:&mdash;"Noose-larning!"
he still uttered, beholding the poacher in
the wood, in his bewildered condition. With much
ado, Hubby was at length fully brought to the remembrance
of what he was about, and being by that
time perfectly sober,&mdash;but dreadfully cramped,&mdash;he
clambered out of the ditch; and though sorely
ashamed of his bedaubed condition, and much more of
his doating folly, he accompanied his friend to the
parsonage-house at Hambleton, and, after much entreaty,
with all the simplicity of his soul, recounted
all he could remember of the whole adventure, commencing
with Gaffer Davy's visit and the present
of the Roman spur.</p>

<p>Oft was the hearty laugh of the plain Oakhamers
raised at Hubby Dickinson's expense, during the remainder
of his life; but the fine old fellow's adventure
never lessened their esteem for him. He was
never permitted to want, even when age had stiffened
his limbs and almost totally closed his eyes and ears.
Town and country were alike proud of the learning
that he had possessed; and the villages, especially,
believed that his like would never be seen in Rutland
again, even to the day of judgment.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>In the lapse of a few months, Hubby got over the
shame and soreness of mind created by his adventure
so entirely, as to be able to relish a joke about it;
and, when his lamp of life was quivering and ready
to sink, nothing would so soon cause it to blaze up
with a healthy and cheerful light as a joke about
the "noose-larning"&mdash;unless it were a grave and
respectful mention of the "Tallagium illustrissimum."
But the lamp of that life went out at last, though its
exit from mortality was peaceful and gentle as the
sinking to sleep of a babe; and never yet has "the
like" been seen in little Rutland, for wondrous learning,
of Master Zerubbabel Dickinson.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>THE BEGGARED GENTLEMAN,<br />
<span class="small">AND<br />
HIS CROOKED STICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There is not a sight in the world more distressful
to the bosom that retains any measure in it of "the
milk of human kindness" than that of an abject,
poverty-stricken fellow-creature, who once rolled in
wealth and plenty. Even the born beggar, who has
lived a beggar all his life, feels an involuntary compassion
for such a man. And, if his fall be attributable
to no avaricious spirit of speculation, or
proud and sensual excess&mdash;but is the effect of Fortune's
untoward frown, or the result of what the
selfish world calls an imprudent practice of relieving
the distressed, the "beggared gentleman" is surely
a legitimate object of universal commiseration.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Clifford!" the most ragged and
hungry inhabitant of Kirton-in-Lindsey would exclaim,
"how much he is to be pitied!&mdash;I never
thought to see him come to this!" And when the
subject of this general pity happened to let fall his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
curious crooked stick through infirmity of age, there
was not a poor man or woman in the little town but
would hasten to restore it to him who seemed to
regard it as the most prizeable possession he had left
in the world. It was moving to see the instant act
of ceremonious courtesy to which the recipient of this
simple heart-kindness would resort. He would raise
his hat, and smile with the same polite expression of
thankfulness as in his best days. No one who saw
him could forget that he had been a gentleman.
And yet the home of his old age was one of squalid
misery!</p>

<p>Hugh Clifford's father was a descendant, by a
younger branch, of a noble family, and had gained
a considerable fortune as a merchant in the port of
Hull. He died in the beginning of the reign of
George the Third, and left his accumulated wealth to
his only son, who was then at college. Hugh hastened
home, on the sudden death of his father, and, by the
advice of a few friends, resolved to carry on his
father's mercantile concern. Twelve months, however,
served to disgust him with business. His
wealth, instead of augmenting, began rapidly to decrease
under the peculations of clerks and managers,
to whom the business was necessarily entrusted, and
he took the resolution, ere it was too late, of retiring,
after he had disposed of his "concern," to a pretty
little estate which had fallen to him, by his mother's
right, at the pleasant little rural town of Kirton-in-Lindsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
that like "a city set on a hill" delights the
eye of the traveller for miles before he reaches it.</p>

<p>For many years, Hugh Clifford's house was a
general refuge for the distressed. None ever knocked
at his gate, and told a tale of want, but they found
instant relief. Hugh Clifford's heart was expansive
as Nature herself. He felt that all men were his
brethren, and that, if he merely tendered them lip-kindness
when they were in sorrow, it was but mockery.
He pondered over the precepts and history of the
Great Exemplar, until, nature and reason combining
to stimulate him, his whole life became an effort to
banish the misery of human-kind. And yet the
sphere in which he acted was comparatively narrow;
for his natural intelligence was not of that high order
which marks out for itself extended fields of enterprize
in philanthropy. Hugh Clifford could not be
termed a planet, like Howard, that visited widely
distant climes in its great dispensing orbit of goodness;
but he was most veritably a star of benevolence,
that cheered with a pure and genial light all within
its neighbourhood who partook of woe and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Living, by his charity, in the very core of poor
men's hearts, and respected for his true politeness
and urbanity by his wealthier neighbours, Hugh
Clifford, while he rendered others happy, was believed
to be himself a very happy man. Nevertheless,
for twenty years after he had passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
prime of age, discomfort and distress were gradually
stealing upon him; and these, too, from a source
which was almost entirely unsuspected by the majority
of his neighbours. True, it was sometimes
remarked that fox-eyed lawyer Merrick was often,
very often, at Clifford cottage,&mdash;and this was considered
to be anomalous, since Hugh Clifford's acquaintances
had been uniformly chosen for some
quality which distinguished them in the little town
and its neighbourhood, as benefactors rather than
oppressors of the poor: albeit lawyer Merrick was
notoriously of the latter description of character.
A few shrewd, hard-bargaining farmers also made a
notch in their memories, now and then, that lawyer
Merrick's purchases of odd bits of land were becoming
frequent now he seemed to be so very oft a
visitor at good Mr. Clifford's.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these slight precurses of suspicion,
it came, at length, upon the ears of the Kirton people,
poor and rich together, like the shock of an earthquake,
that "poor good old Mr. Clifford was turned
bodily out of doors, with nothing but the clothes on
his back and his favourite crooked stick in his hand,
a complete pauper, for that he had been getting into
lawyer Merrick's debt for years and years, by borrowing
small sums upon his estate, whereby all he
was worth was mortgaged to the lawyer, who had
now suddenly foreclosed, and pounced upon house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and land, pushing good old Mr. Clifford away, by
the shoulders!"</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Clifford!" was echoed by every body;&mdash;but
who helped "poor Mr. Clifford?"</p>

<p>There lay the hardest fact in the good man's history.
The little tradesmen who had shared his daily
orders for the relief of the miserable had none of them
more than five pounds in their books against him;
but each of them made out a bill of thrice the amount
of their debt, and so figured in the world's compassion
as great losers by the "beggared gentleman," instead
of ingrates, when they shut their doors against him.
The farmers shook their heads, and buttoned up their
fobs, saying, "It was no wonder that all was over
with Mr. Clifford: he ought to have remembered
that, 'Charity begins at home.'" The parish parson,
who was the prime whip of the neighbourhood, and
spent more days of the year with 'Squire Harrison's
hounds than he spent in his pulpit and study, thrice
told, only struck his top-boots violently with his
whip, and said, "God bless me! I always thought
the poor fellow was cracked in his upper story!
Why, he must have meant to end his days in an
alms-house, or he would not have undertaken to
keep all the poor in my parish and the surrounding
parishes to boot!" and, springing into the stirrups,
was out of sight in a minute.</p>

<p>And into an alms-house poor Hugh Clifford went,
but not until he had wandered through the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
town three or four times, leaning upon his curious
crooked stick, and looking as if unconscious of the
crowd of tearful poor men and women that followed
him. At first, the parish overseers waited, in the
expectation that, as a matter of course, either the
parson or some of the "better sort of people" would
invite the "beggared gentleman" into their houses;
but when it was seen that no such invitation was
given, while, all the time, the poor fallen man was
wandering in the street with derangement manifest
in his looks, the puzzled overseers laid their heads
together, and agreed that one of the alms-houses
should be apportioned for Mr. Clifford's home, and
that an old deaf female pauper should be put under
the same roof to wait upon him.</p>

<p>For many days the poor victim to his own goodness
was silent and helpless, and, by order of the
parish surgeon, was disturbed, on the rugged bed
where he lay, no oftener than was necessary to
arouse him in order that he might be fed; for his
mental powers seemed to have undergone so complete
a paralysis as to render him insensible to the calls of
nature. After the lapse of some weeks, during the
latter half of which he seemed to be absorbed in abstract
devotion, poor Hugh Clifford's mind rallied.
And now the meekness with which he bore his adversity
was equally remarkable with the perfectness
of that pity he had evermore displayed for the
wretched during the term of his prosperity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
accepted the smallest act of kindness with gratitude;
and the poor deaf old female pauper never knew what
it was to hear him utter a word of complaint.</p>

<p>The remnant of his life may be summed up in a
few lines. All who had the means of ameliorating
his lot neglected him; and all who wished for the
means, and had hearts to have used them in his relief,
lacked them. He lived years in his beggared
condition, and died calmly and quietly, complaining
of nothing in the world, nor of the world itself, and
leaving but one request,&mdash;that his curious crooked
stick might be placed by his right side, in his coffin,
and buried with him!</p>

<p>The deaf old female pauper who had waited on
him did not fail to communicate this strange request
to the parish overseers when they came to look at
Hugh Clifford's corpse, prior to giving orders for his
burial. It may be guessed that the singular request
gave rise to much wonder and some enquiry. But
the old female could only answer that the good gentleman
would often place his odd-looking walking-stick
in the corner, and sit on his bedside looking
very intently upon it; and that often he would turn
the other side of it to the wall, and then sit and look
at it again; and several times she had seen him take
a little note-book from his coat pocket, at the breast,
and write in it, looking, ever and anon, at the
curious crooked stick.</p>

<p>The latter part of the old female's communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
of course occasioned a search. The pocket-book was
found, and in it a paper covered with a close manuscript
of a most curious character, but one that served
to display the anatomy of poor Hugh Clifford's heart
under his misfortunes more fully than it could have
been laid open and read in either death-bed confession,
or funeral sermon. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="in0 p2t p1b">"<i>A Soliloquy on my only faithful and never-failing
friend,&mdash;my beloved and valued crooked stick.</i></p>

<p>"Ay, there thou art,&mdash;my own crooked stick!&mdash;My
heart cleaves to thee, in thy crookedness; and I
love thus to look upon thee, more and more, daily,
as thou leanest by the wall in that corner,&mdash;remembering
that thou and I were not always tenants of
an alms-house.</p>

<p>"I love to look upon thee, with a melancholy yet
pleasurable love, beholding that thou preservest thy
crooked identity,&mdash;yea, remainest as crooked as ever
thou wert! I know not whether aught within me,
or, indeed, any thing but thyself without me, be still
the same as on that beautiful summer eve when, more
than fifty years ago, I cut thee from the venerable
crab-tree whereon thou didst grow, and we formed
our inseparable friendship.</p>

<p>"The wise men of this age would tell me that not
a particle of the body I had then, at nineteen, is to
be found in this old body of threescore and ten,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
that blood, bone, brains, and all its other youthful
components, are changed. I know not, my dear
crooked crab-stick, how truly they may speak; but
this I know,&mdash;that I then was proud of a perfect
and spotless array of teeth, while, now, my old
gums are tenantless; that then my eyes were sharp
and strong, while now I see, with the utmost difficulty,
objects removed half a yard from my nose;
that then my ears were instruments of use, and
porches for receiving the brain's most precious visitants,
the sounds of music,&mdash;while, now, they only
serve to plague me when I see people's lips moving,
and think, like other old fools, that folks are always
talking about me; and, that I used to have 'a
handsome head of hair,' as my barber always called
it, on quarter-day, when he expected his salary,&mdash;while,
now, I behold a perpetual winter above my
brow, and on my brow itself!</p>

<p>"But, ah! my faithful friend, why should I lament
the changes which have come upon me? Fate, or
Fortune, or whatever power I might fancifully charge
with my evil day, cannot avenge herself of me so
bitterly as she might,&mdash;if I had teeth to be set on
edge with inferior food,&mdash;eyes to be offended with
the rude shapes of this straw mattrass and rush-bottomed
chair,&mdash;ears to be tormented with the jangling
of earthen porringers, as the poor deaf old woman
knocks them against each other,&mdash;and hair which I
could not dress for lack of a mirror!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"And then, as to my inner man, good lack,
my beloved crooked crab-stick! though thou remainest
the same, how is this my inner man changed!
ay, how hath it changed and changed again, since
our first dear friendship was formed! Yet I said in
my heart, once, that my mind could never change
in its regard for what I was pleased to call 'certain
great principles!' Alack! I have lived to feel uncertain
about the certainty and greatness of almost
all principles! and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But stop! how is this, that having taken thee
into my hand, I begin, just now, to question the
reality of thy crookedness? Art thou really so very,
very crooked, my dearly beloved stick?</p>

<p>"There! I place thee, again, in thy own corner,
that so thou mayst lean against thy own spot in the
wall, and lo! thy crookedness is made, once more,
fully manifest! No, no, my friend&mdash;for Hugh Clifford
loves thee too well and sincerely to call himself
thy 'master,' and think of thee as of a slave!&mdash;no,
no, it is too late in life for the 'beggared gentleman'
to deceive himself&mdash;thou <i>art</i> crooked, crooked
indeed!</p>

<p>"But ah! my beloved stick, it is for thy crookedness
I love thee, above all, though not for it alone.
I avow to thee, as I have often avowed, in times
past, when no human ear heard me, that I thank
thee, my faithful, crooked, unfailing friend, for all
thy service. Twice, when wielded by my right arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
didst though enable me to deliver a weak fellow-creature
from his stronger, who would have slain
him because he had not filthy gold or silver to
satisfy the robber: ten times didst thou empower
me to wrest open the cottage doors of dying human
beings deserted by their kind, and unable to arise
and welcome their deliverer: nay, once didst thou
enable me to preserve my own poor life when the
plunderer who now possesseth my house and land
would have secretly and bloodily taken it!</p>

<p>"What though it bringeth some sorrow to remember
the angelic face and form I saw, for the last
time, but an hour before I cut thee from thy parent
tree, Ah! how well doth life assort the lot of its
inheritors, even when they most deeply repine! The
sea devoured my Mary&mdash;my beauty, my only love,
and I repined that she was not spared to share my
riches and possessions; alas! would she not have had
to share my lot, also, in this alms-house? Indeed,
my friend, I was blessed that I gained thy friendship
that night, when my love was taken from me, for
how great a comfort hast thou been to me!</p>

<p>"I tender thee these my heartfelt thanks, now
our long and interesting friendship is in the yellow
leaf! Many a mile hast thou travelled with me,&mdash;unfailingly
hast thou supported my steps in manhood
and old age,&mdash;in all weathers,&mdash;and never shrunk
from me, nor upbraided either my haste or my tarrying,
my speed or my slowness, my lavishness or my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
poverty; but Hugh Clifford cannot expect, in the
nature of things, to remain with thee much longer.
He loves thee so well, that he would fain thou
mightst be laid by his side in the grave: yet such
a request may be met churlishly by those who provide
Hugh's coffin,&mdash;and thou mayst become the support
of another, who will, peradventure, proudly call
thee his 'property' instead of his 'companion!'"</p>

<p>"Farewell, then, my dearly-beloved and highly
valued friend&mdash;farewell! but not before I have
more fully thanked thee:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Above all, my precious crooked stick, I return
thee hearty thanks that thou hast been to me a truthful
mirror&mdash;yea, a bright and glittering looking-glass,&mdash;although
the eye of the undiscerning, and of
those who judge after the outward seeming and surface
appearance, would misreckon thee to be a dry,
dull, opaque crooked crab-stick! Yea, a mirror, I
say, thou hast been to me,&mdash;reflecting upon my spiritual
retina,&mdash;the judgment,&mdash;that great fact, which,
in my folly, I oft would have hidden from myself,&mdash;that
I resembled thee!</p>

<p>"Yet, thou pitiedest me in thy heart,&mdash;hard and
unfeeling as some would say that heart must be, the
heart of a crooked crab-stick!&mdash;yea, thou pitiedst
me therein, and didst still from thy old corner regard
me with the same unflatteringly argumentative
and admonitory aspect,&mdash;penetrating <i>my</i> heart with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the faithful language of <i>thine</i>: 'Hugh! look at me
and know thyself.'</p>

<p>"And I <i>have</i> looked at thee, and I do <i>now</i> look
at thee, and in thy veritable crookedness I behold
my own!"</p>

<p>"Reader,&mdash;who wilt find this my solemn and earnest
soliloquy, when I am gone,&mdash;hast thou a crooked
stick?</p>

<p>"'I, Mr. Clifford!' answers some young puppy of
one-and-twenty, who, perchance, may take my paper
into his dainty fingers, 'I am not so vulgar as to
carry a crooked stick: my cane is most beautifully
polished, and it is a perfectly straight one!'"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! my brave lad! I sought not thy answer:
do not be so pert: think more, and talk less,
for the next thirty years; and then re-consider my
question.</p>

<p>"'I understand your censorious query, Mr. Clifford,'
says another, some score of years older, and
with less buckram but more gauze in his composition&mdash;'I
understand you: but the fact is, <i>my</i> stick
is <i>not</i> a crooked stick: it is perfectly straight, and
hath always been straight: 'tis the evil-disposed and
calumnious world who call it crooked: albeit, if they
would only view it aright, they would perceive that
all the parts of it which they think crooked and perverse
are direct as a geometrical right line!'</p>

<p>"Alas, my reader with the pretended straight stick!
thou pratest in vain to Hugh Clifford, the 'beggared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
gentleman!' I tell thee, plainly, thy stick is, like
mine, a crooked one; nay, I tell thee, that every
man's stick is but a crooked stick. And, of all curses
under which this poor abused world groans, may it
be speedily and effectually delivered, I pray, in my
old age and in an alms-house, from the cant of the
starched faces who assure their fellow-creatures with
so much show of sanctity that their crooked sticks
are straight ones!</p>

<p>"Farewell, then, once again, my beloved but
crooked friend, and thanks for thy faithfulness!
alas, that I neglected to use thy silent admonitions
as I ought to have used them, when the serpent who
wrecked me was wont to shed his false tears while I
related my tales of the poor in his ears! Fool that
I was to take those tears, and the offers to lend more
money that followed, for proofs of his feeling heart!
Ah, my friend, had I to spend life again, I would
attend more closely to thy monitions, and would not
credit a man's professions of humanity, unless they
cost him something! But it is too late to repent at
what I fear I could not have avoided if I had even
seen my error.</p>

<p>"Let it pass! Hugh Clifford's heart danceth for
joy, even amidst the squalor of an alms-house, that
he can point to no inconsiderable portion of his life,
and say with truth regarding it, as one said of old&mdash;'When
the ear heard me, then it blessed me:
and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
because I delivered the poor that cried, and the
fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The
blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.'&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yet see I my image in thine, my dear faithful
friend! my stick is but a crooked one, though
I have done some little good in my life! Ostentation
hath mixed itself, more or less, with my purest
charities,&mdash;anger hath too often burned in my bosom
till the morning light: I have not always 'done as I
would be done by;' I have too often behaved contemptuously
to my fellow-creatures, forgetting that
I was but a poor, pitiful earth-worm, like themselves.
I am but a <i>crooked</i> stick, like thee, my beloved friend,
with all my imagined excellency.</p>

<p>"But, finally, I thank thee, that thou hast perseveringly
shown me that I was not perfect: thou
hast preserved me from self-deceit, or at least hast
chased it away, when it hath led me into temporary
captivity.</p>

<p>"Farewell, then, my beloved crooked stick!&mdash;and
if he who, first or last, readeth this my serious soliloquy
feeleth inclined to laugh thereat, let him
answer my question, when I ask him if <i>he</i> be able to
point to one human thing that hath been to him
what thou hast been to me&mdash;<i>for fifty years, an ever-faithful
and never-failing friend</i>?"</p>

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
NURTURE OF A YOUNG SAILOR;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
THE HISTORY OF COCKLE TOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Cockle Tom was born in poverty, cradled in hardship,
and schooled, never in the alphabet, but perpetually
in endurance of labour, hunger, and fatigue.
His manhood was brief; but his death was generous
and heroic. He was one of the humble children of
genuine romance, which England produces in profusion,
but whose lives are unchronicled, and the
moral of their story lost, simply from the fact that,
though full of virtuous ambition, they are untainted
with vain-glory: they neither seek for notice in
cities, nor lay claim to distinction in public assemblies;
but they restlessly seek to obtain and preserve
the reputation that they are hard-workers, undaunted
by any danger, and capable of sustaining any amount
of fatigue, or undertaking any risk, even that of life
itself, to benefit the existence or preserve the life of
a fellow-creature. Such is genuine Saxon character&mdash;genuine
old English nature: what elements for
useful greatness in a nation, if its rulers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Alfreds! But to proceed with our humble biography:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cockle Tom was born at Northcotes-on-the-Sands,
a slender, straggling village, bleakly situate on the
Lincolnshire sea-coast, and at no great distance from
the mouth of the Humber. His father was a simple
fisherman, who rented the "cockle sands," as they
were called,&mdash;an extent of something more than a
mile, belonging to the parish of Northcotes, and possessed
in fee-simple by the principal landholder in
the neighbourhood. Having married young, and
being early the head of a numerous small family,
Tom's father, from the penury of his condition, was
constrained to introduce every one of his male children,
at least, to the rough and painful labour of
gathering cockles on the sea-beach by the time they
had reached the tender age of five years. And at
that age was Tom first taken, by his elder brothers,
without shoes or stockings, with a bundle of rags
rather than clothes around him, and a red flannel
night-cap tied fast round his head, to gather the
shell-fish, by scraping them out of the sand with his
little hands, and putting them into a small hempen
bag tied round his loins. Little Tom was very eager
to go;&mdash;for "the sea! the sea!" was his unvarying
song (chanted in a wild, untaught melody which perhaps
even Ne&#252;komm himself would have thought
beautiful, could he have listened to it) from the
day when he was three years old, the first day on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
which his father bore him on shoulder to gaze upon
the ships riding in the German Ocean. But poor
little Tom cried bitterly with frozen hands, and cold,
and hunger, before the day was over, and it was time
to return to his mother's aproned knee, and the
soothing heaven of sympathy that dwelt on her
tongue and in her eyes.</p>

<p>Yet, on the morrow, little Tom would go again.
The father would have left him at home till the
Spring strengthened and the sun came nearer, for it
was but early March as yet; but the little adventurer
was too true to his nature to accept the boon.
And from that day, summer and winter, except when
even the father himself was compelled to stay at
home by reason of an unusual storm, Tom continued
to mount his little red night-cap, like the rest, and
make one among the picturesque line of industrious
stragglers on the sea-beach. To school Tom never
went in his life: though his lot would not have been
more highly favoured in that respect, had he been
the child of a peasant in the interior, or even the son
of a decent mechanic in Lincolnshire, at that period,&mdash;for
we are speaking of events of seventy years'
date, from their commencement to our own time,&mdash;and
at that far-back period the idea of sending a poor
man's child to school was regarded as a piece of over-weening
pride that deserved no gentle rebuke from
"the better sort of people." But what though he
could never read? he could make boats; and indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
his earliest error was a display of that kind of ingenuity,
for he bored a hole in the bottom of his
mother's bread-tin when but four years' old, stuck a
wooden mast in it, fitted on a sail, and set it afloat
on the surface of a brook that ran by the end of his
father's little garden; and, while he clapped his little
hands in ecstasy, away dashed his ship to the sea!
He was severely chidden for this, but <i>not</i> flogged:
that was not his mother's way; she happened to have
too much good sense to brutify her offspring: and
the lecture served to shew him that he had done
foolishly,&mdash;but it did not annihilate that passion for
ships and the sea which his first sight of them had
created within him. He could make boats&mdash;did we
say? ay, and he made a ship, too,&mdash;such a ship!&mdash;though
this was when he was ten years old, and had
seen the magnificent merchant-vessels from the Mediterranean
and the West Indies go by in full sail
for the Humber and the port of Hull,&mdash;such a
ship, with masts, and yards, and rigging, and portholes,
and even miniature sailors,&mdash;it was so wondrous
a piece of art as the oldest villager in Northcotes
had never seen, and rendered little Tom the
every-day talk of all its inhabitants. Such talk did
not render little Tom vain, however, for his yearning
mind had influenced his hands to form the ship from
no principle of praise-seeking: it was a type that
signified he meant to sail in such an ocean-vehicle&mdash;if
the simple people could so have read it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>Unmindful of praise, and true to the energy that
was growing within him, little Tom learnt to swim,
and dive, and play with the huge ocean as familiarly
as with his elder brothers. More especially if a
vessel chanced to anchor near the shore, either to
wait for a change of wind, or to barter for fish, that
was a temptation so powerful with Tom, that he seldom
waited for his father's return, if at a distance
with the boat,&mdash;but into the wave he would plunge,
and speedily gain the vessel, becoming, in a few
minutes, a favourite with every one on board, for his
sense and activity. Tom's brothers shared the pleasure,
or at least the benefits, of these ventures, though
they were neither skilful nor courageous enough to
share the peril; for little Tom usually returned,
bearing by the strings in his mouth, like a water dog,
his cockle-bag filled with precious scraps of sea-biscuit,
and sometimes a bit or two of boiled salt beef,&mdash;a
priceless luxury for the brothers, to whom noble
little Tom invariably gave up the bag, as soon as he
reached the shore.</p>

<p>By the time that Tom was regularly entered as
one of his poor father's labouring band, the strongest
of his three elder brothers was taken by the father,
into the little boat, taught to assist in managing the
bladdered nets, and so advanced from a mere cockle-gatherer
to an embryo fisherman. The two next
brothers were neither sufficiently strong, active, or
enterprising, ever to rival the oldest; but when Tom
was ten years old, though Jack was fifteen, his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
preferred taking him in the boat. The little hero
not only gained greater knowledge, but rapidly grew
in courage, presence of mind, and plan for adventure,
by the change. In fact, the father's circumstances
were speedily bettered by his child's intelligence and
energy.</p>

<p>One day, while his father was "dealing" the largest
net out of the boat, so as to prevent its getting
"foul," and little Tom was riding upon the old
horse which the father was necessitated to keep for
his daily use, towing the end of the net by a line to
the required distance into the water, he perceived
that he was among an unusually large shoal of fine
fish,&mdash;and so swam the horse out, considerably, with
the intent to have a full sweep of the treasure. Much
to the lad's chagrin, however, the father hallooed, and
motioned, and menaced, for him to come back; and
so Tom, who was too true a lad to disobey when his
father seemed so angry, was constrained to give up
his prize, and the result was that the father had to
meet his usual chapman for the Louth market with
only a very pitiful take of fish for the day. Tom
was then but twelve years old, but his shrewdness
discerned how greatly these timid acts of his father
served to gird in the hungry family with straitness.
He had never disobeyed on a large scale before; but
his spirit prompted him to what, according to his
unschooled casuistry, he conceived to be a virtuous
disobedience, now&mdash;and yet it was a venturous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
perilous deed for a child that he undertook. And
thus he went about it.</p>

<p>He drew his mother aside, as soon as they returned
home in the evening, and dazzled her imagination
with his brilliant and excited account of the value
and fineness of the shoal he had seen, and told her
he was resolved to have them before the next morning.</p>

<p>"The Lord help thee, bairn!" exclaimed the
mother; "what art thou talking of?"</p>

<p>"Talking sense, mother," said Tom; "and you'll
see it: for you must sit up till Jack and I come back
with the old horse: we'll set off as soon as my fayther
has gone to bed and fallen fast asleep."</p>

<p>"Jack!" cried the mother, "why, it'll make him
tremble to talk o' such a thing!"</p>

<p>"The more's the shame for him, then," replied the
little hero; "if he does tremble, and durst not go,
I shall think him a lubber"&mdash;a word that Tom had
learnt from the sailors, and, of course, was very fond
of using: "the moon's at full, and we can see as well
as by daylight to manage the net."</p>

<p>"Thou'lt be drownded, bairn," said the mother;
"and, besides, the fish may be all gone from where
thou saw 'em this morning."</p>

<p>"Not they," insisted Tom; "they're brits, mother,&mdash;fine
large brits," he repeated, with sparkling eyes;
"and you've heard my fayther say over and over
again that flat fish stay in a snug bottom for days
together. I saw 'em spread all along the far flat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
within the sunk rocks, toward Donna Hook: they've
found fine shelter, and plenty to feed on, no doubt,
and they won't go away; they'll make pounds, mother&mdash;and
we need money, you know, mother."</p>

<p>Tom's mother gazed at him with fond wonder: so
much ardour, so much earnest zeal to benefit his
parents, and brothers and sisters, in one so young&mdash;it
was almost too much for her, and the tears rose, as
she stood silently looking at her child, with one hand
on his shoulder, and his eager, entreating eyes penetrating
into her very soul to learn whether he would
win her consent. He prevailed, however, and she
heard the last footsteps of the old horse, as it slowly
left the door of the cottage, with Tom and Jack on
its back, and the net packed behind, with feelings of
excited apprehension she had not felt since the first
storm after her marriage, when her husband was out
at sea.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the father, half awaking
at the sound of the horse's feet, and wondering that
his wife was still up; but she rendered him some
evasive answer, and continued darning one of the
children's rent garments, telling him that she must
have it done for the boy to put on in the morning.
Leaving the reader to imagine the mother's agonising
doubts and fears, and anxious listenings to the movement
of every changeful sound of the night, let us
attend to Tom and his brother, and their daring adventure.
Not that it needs any expanded description,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
it was entered upon, and achieved, with all Tom's
soul thrown into it, in such a way as to render it
memorable to Jack's latest day, when Jack told it to
his children. Jack was fearful enough at remaining
alone in the boat to hand out the net by moonlight,&mdash;but
Tom was dashing along on the old horse that was
a good swimmer, and was not long in doubling and
returning. Again and again was their swoop of the
sea repeated, till their strength was well-nigh exhausted
with toiling to carry on land their loads of
fish. A mighty harvest from the great waters it
was, to be reaped by the energy and intrepidity of a
boy of twelve years old. The fish were concealed
in a "crike" or small freshet, a little removed from
the beach, where it was easy to form a dam; and with
one good load upon the old horse, fastened in the
folded net, the lads set off on foot, long before daylight,
from the beach, and speedily were at their
father's cottage-door with this earnest of their booty.</p>

<p>"Whoa hoa!" cried Tom aloud to the old horse,
almost before it was time to stop; and his mother,
who was already in front of her cottage, lifted up her
closed hand, and shook it, and cried, "Hush, bairn,&mdash;whisht,
whisht!&mdash;thy fayther will hear thee, and
what's to be done then?"</p>

<p>But Tom was neither to be hushed nor whished.
"Tell my fayther to get up, and take Dick and
Will with him to fetch the rest o' the brits and rays,
while Jack and I have some breakfast, for we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
hungry above a bit," he said; and he tumbled the
fish out of the net, and told his mother they had left
ten times as many in the crike. What cared Tom
whether his father felt inclined to scold or not? He
knew that the booty would silently and overwhelmingly
plead his pardon. And oh, the trembling joy
and pride of the poor mother,&mdash;her thoughts of
large pecuniary relief and admiration of her child's
noble act, combining, and causing her to prattle with
so much elation that she scarcely knew what she
said!</p>

<p>Seven pounds, in sterling English money, Tom's
poor father made of his child's night adventure: a
sum he had never approached for one day's, no, nor
one week's labour in his little boat, since he had
possessed it. Need it be said that Tom's father was
proud of him? He loved all his children: they and
his wife were his jewels, his only idols in the world;
and to picture truly his yearnings for their happiness,
as he cast a thought towards his cottage, or counted
his boys by their little red caps, toiling, meanwhile,
afar off from the beach where the children straggled
sometimes at great distances from each other, at their
hardy employ,&mdash;to tell what truly exalted thinkings
passed hourly through the mind of that poor fisherman,
tossed upon the surge often a whole day without
a fragment of gain, and yet clinging with glowing love
to his wife and children on land,&mdash;oh, it would form
a theme to kindle the sweetest eloquence of the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
yet godlike Shakspere himself! But it was natural
that Tom should become his father's peculiar pride,
for he was, indeed, a child to be proud of.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a melancholy sound, the first
request of that heroic boy, when he became fourteen&mdash;a
sorrowful note in the ears of his doting
parents&mdash;that he might become a sailor, and leave
them! The father and mother exchanged a dreary
look, and said nought. It was a request they might
expect, one day or other, for the lad had always
raved about the darling life of a sailor, and he was
now becoming of an age when it was fit he should
enter on such a profession as he intended to follow
for life: but yet they had always put the thought
aside, and clung to the enjoyment of possessing such
a son, and beholding him as "the light of their eyes,"
daily. Tom saw and felt what his parents endured
when he presented his first request, and he did not
renew it till another month had flown, and a Boston
sloop was lying off the cockle-sands, laden with
timber from Hull, when he again asked if he might
go for a sailor. This time, however, the question
was put under circumstances which seemed to soften
the dread of separation. Boston was a Lincolnshire
port, and a voyage thither and back, on trial, would
soon be performed, so that they would soon see their
darling again; and therefore his parents gave consent
for Tom's departure.</p>

<p>The boy became as much the darling of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
crew in the sloop, during their brief voyage, as he
had been of his father and mother. They gave him
the name which stuck to him through life, as soon as
they had heard his history, to which, indeed, they
were scarcely strangers, for it was not the first time
he had been on board their shallop. And "Cockle
Tom" was proud to tell his new name when he saw
his home again: it had been given him by sailors,
and it was, therefore, more honourable in his estimation
than knighthood or nobility given by a monarch
would have been, had he known of either.</p>

<p>There was now no putting off the complete separation
from their noblest child for Tom's parents.
He had fully made up his mind to live on the sea,
his darling element: and, besides, he had been to
Hull, the port to which the Boston sloop traded, and
had seen the Greenland whale-ships, and talked with
the sailors till he was all excitement for the noble
daring of joining in an attack upon the vast sea-monsters,
and seeing the mountain icebergs, and
hearing the roaring of the white bears. His father
therefore prepared clothing for the lad, and began to
think of setting out with him for Hull, in order to
see him safely committed, as a sailor-apprentice, to
the care of some kind and fatherly sort of Greenland
captain.</p>

<p>It was a dull week that young Cockle Tom passed
at home; for, despite his enthusiasm, the complete
separation from his parents was a thought that cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
him to the quick. Did, then, the fisherman's child,
who had been led forth to endure the cold sea wind,
and labour, and hunger, from infancy, love his
parents? Ay, that did he, and with such a love
as you know nothing of, young spruce, who have
been to boarding-school, and have since become
versed in all the hollownesses of "respectable life."
If there was a sacred corner in Tom's heart, it was
that where the precious images of his father and
mother were enshrined. Toil, fatigue, hunger, pain,
loss of sleep, nay, death itself, he would have encountered
at any moment to benefit them; and, young
as he was, he formed strong judgments on men's characters
who failed in parental duty. He never
swore but once in his life, before leaving home, and
that was when a young farmer in the parish married
a flaunting wife, and gave up his aged father, blind
and palsy-stricken, to be placed in an alms-house.
"D&mdash;n his eyes!" exclaimed young Tom, while his
own eyes flashed fire, "I should like to grapple his
weasand, as big as he is!" That was a rude expression,
and a strange one, too, for a boy of fourteen;
but while his mother reproved it with such a look as
she had never given him before,&mdash;and he blushed
like scarlet, and promised, with tears in his eyes,
never to swear again,&mdash;yet she read within Tom's
heart, by the aid of those few syllables, the existence
of a principle which, she felt, more truly ennobled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
her child than the highest earthly titles would have
aggrandised him.</p>

<p>It was some relief to young Tom to reflect that his
parents were now in comparatively comfortable circumstances,
and chiefly through his means. The ice
of timidity once broken, Jack had become more adventurous,
and within one year, by the joint efforts
of the two brothers, so great an increase took place
in the fish the father had to offer for sale, that he
was enabled to buy the little cottage in which he
lived, with the garden adjoining, as well as to clothe
his whole family. The next year furnished a new
and larger boat, and an extra horse, besides stocking
the little purse of the father with a few spare guineas
in gold&mdash;the noble old spade-aces which "looked so
much like <i>real</i> money," as our forefathers used to say,
when they first saw the queer, "fly-away-blow-away"
paper money.</p>

<p>Did they cry&mdash;Tom, or his mother&mdash;when the
separation came? Ay, and brothers, and sisters,
and father too, as he was about to depart with him&mdash;real
tears, to be sure; for, as much like their native
oaks as our genuine old English race were in their
hardihood and endurance of storms, their hearts were
of the tenderest&mdash;in the right place. A still severer
feeling of desolation was experienced by Tom and
his father when they parted at Hull; but Tom
"girt up the loins of his mind," and buried his sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
in listening to the sailors' talk, and in thinking
of his coming adventures.</p>

<p>And now "the history of Cockle Tom" may end;
for our purpose is not to write a long story, but to
show how a simple and yet truly noble character may
be formed: and that purpose is accomplished as
well as we are able to reach it. For the remainder
of Cockle Tom's life,&mdash;it was that of the true English
sailor,&mdash;full of generosity and noble daring,
shaded, here and there, with a dash of passion, or a
fit of insobriety at the end of a long voyage of suffering,
but tinted to brilliancy with many an act of
exalted sacrifice. Five voyages Cockle Tom made to
Greenland, or the Straits; three to the West Indies,
and one to the East; six times he passed through the
Straits of Gibraltar and visited Malta, or Corfu, or
Constantinople; and four times he voyaged to the
Guinea coast, ere he reached the age of thirty. That
was the limit of his life; but he had saved as many
lives as he numbered years by that time. As an
expert swimmer,&mdash;as a soul that would venture even
into the jaws of death to save a drowning man,&mdash;as
a shipmate that would always take the severer share
of toil and ease another,&mdash;as an agile and clever
mariner that was unexcelled in the rapidity and perfection
with which he could execute any manoeuvre in
the management of his ship,&mdash;as the heart of fun and
merriment,&mdash;and as the lad whose purse was ever
at the command of a brother in need,&mdash;Cockle Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
was the glory and pride of every "true British tar"
who knew him.</p>

<p>And how fresh did his filial love remain amidst
separation and newness of scene! His father and
mother kept that sacred corner in his heart, perfectly
unrivalled, for many a long year; and when
he admitted another fair image there it was not
allowed to encroach upon the consecrated room occupied
by the old ones. He loved his wife, whom
he married at five-and-twenty, and she deserved his
love; but he did not love his parents the less for
that. They received many a solid proof of his affection,
although they seldom saw him; and the news
of his death, though it did not distract them with
unseemly grief, dimmed the brightness of their declining
days.</p>

<p>Cockle Tom lay in harbour at Hull, after his return
from the fourth Guinea voyage: his vessel was
delivered of its cargo: a friend had written "home"
for him,&mdash;for his father's cottage was "home"
with him, even after he had married and had a little
neat house in Hull. On the morrow, his young wife
and himself were to have set out to see his aged
parents once more, when, in the fineness of the
evening, while numerous pleasure-boats were jostling
each other in the narrow space of the harbour,
thronged as it was with large and small craft, one
boat upset, and five human lives were in danger. In
a moment, Tom had plunged from the deck where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
he stood, and the next moment had placed two in
safety in one of the boats: a second struggle, and
two more were rescued; but, in attempting to save
the last, the dying struggler, or the cramp, overpowered
him, and he sunk to rise no more! Such
was the consistent end of the life of Cockle Tom,&mdash;the
"true British sailor."</p>

<p>"A bold peasantry, their country's pride," are
fast fading: may our other twin jewel in English national
character&mdash;the noble sailor&mdash;ever preserve its
lustre!</p>

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
LAST DAYS OF AN OLD SAILOR;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"BUTTER YOUR SHIRT!<br />
SING TANTARA-BOBUS, MAKE SHIFT!"</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Among the few survivors of our "glorious" sea-fights
which the Peace sent home to Gainsbro', a busy
little port on the Trent, was old Matthew Hardcastle,
a veteran of threescore and ten, and something more.
It was said that Matthew might have been discharged
from ship-board some years earlier; but his attachment
to the sea was extreme, and he was at length,
to speak plainly, forced out of the navy.</p>

<p>Gainsbro' was, at that particular period, somewhat
fertile in the production of eccentric folk, for Joe
Hornby was then to be seen in it, with his hat stuck
full of field flowers, and sometimes, to the peril of
its "crown," fixed on his head wrong side upwards,
because "the world was turned upside down;" and
the septuagenarian spinster, Nelly Fish, might be
seen flaunting along the narrow causeway, her strange
pile of five or six straw hats, which she wore one
upon another, to show that "she knew all the fashions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
that had been, as well as those that were;"&mdash;and Martin
Jackson would, ever and anon, sally forth in some
odd guise that demonstrated his lunacy; for to-day
he might be seen covered with papers on which were
written all kinds of queer criticisms on the rulers of the
day, and to-morrow he would go through the streets
clad in his wife's chemise for an outer robe, and wearing
an old horseman's helmet with a fox's tail for a plume,
while half-a-dozen terriers yelped away at his heels,
following thick and fast to the mad hunter's cries of
"Yo-ho! yo-ho! Hark forward! Tantivy! Yo-ho!
yo-ho!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the strange relics of humanity
which afforded grave problems for those who were
able to moralise, or thought they were, at that time,
in Gainsbro'; but, amidst all and sundry of its human
catalogue, none of the curious articles thereof attracted
more general attention, as they passed to and
fro in the streets of the little town, than the veteran
warrior-seaman, Matthew Hardcastle. Indeed, Matthew
was beheld, by "gentle and simple," in a different
light to the eccentrics, poor things! before
mentioned. The world, in spite of its conviction that
it is wrong to laugh, laughs on at the antics and
whims of the helpless beings it calls "insane;" and
Gainsbro' followed the way of the world in laughing,
too often, at poor Joe Hornby, and Nelly Fish, and
Martin Jackson; but it was by no means a custom to
laugh at Matthew Hardcastle.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>Matthew was a tall, well-built old fellow, and did
not lose an inch of his height, notwithstanding his
very advanced age. His brave face resembled more
the gnarled bark of an old oak than any other thing
that ever existed; it was a real sea-faring face, was
Matthew's, if ever a man wore one in this world.
And then his wig! All the town talked of Matthew
Hardcastle's wig. It did not fall below the shoulders,
like the princely-looking old wigs of the days of
Marlborough; but it was a very grand, burly wig,
for all that. It reached below the ears of the fine old
man, considerably; and it displayed five tiers of
curls,&mdash;glorious curls they were! Matthew's grand
three-cocked hat, too,&mdash;for he and old George Laughton,
the currier, with his soul of independence, and
Charley Careless, the little high-spirited silversmith,
were the three last men in Gainsbro' who refused to put
away the splendid head-covering of their forefathers
for the paltry upper gear of modern times,&mdash;Matthew's
three-cocked hat stood higher behind than it
did before, and, conjoined with the grandeur of his
wig, caused Matthew to look as bold and imposing as
a brigadier major! And whoever met Matthew on
the causeway, rocking as he went with a regular
naval kind of motion, and supporting his aged steps
by a bamboo in either hand, was sure to say, "Good
morning to you, Matthew! I hope you are quite
well this morning!" if they were considered to be his
equals or superiors in rank; while all the little boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and girls were wont to stop and bow or courtesy to
him, and say, "Your sarvant, Matthew!" Such was
the real honour paid to the aged sailor who had fought
"the battles of his country," as they were called.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when all this show of
respect to the brave old sailor ceased, for he lived too
long! Twenty more years made his age hard upon
one hundred. That was a rare age to live; but it
would have been better for Matthew if he had died
ten years earlier, for he lived till the effects of the
"glorious" battles in which he had been engaged
began to be felt&mdash;and felt grievously, even in that
district, which you will deem comparatively happy
when viewed after your mind's eye has been dwelling
on the fathomless miseries of our dense hives of manufacture.
He lived till hungry and ragged labourers
began to stand daily in melancholy groups, and with
folded arms, in the streets, and till the parish authorities
began to talk of pulling down the old workhouse, to
build a new "bastile" on the lovely green spot where
the children used to resort to play at sand-mills!</p>

<p>Matthew felt the change in the "civilisation," as
it was called, of the times, sensibly, as old as he was;
but there was an inexhaustible spring of vivacity in
the old seaman's noble nature, and in spite of age,
infirmities, and bad times, Matthew Hardcastle was
the merriest, as well as the oldest man in Gainsbro'.
"Butter your shirt, sing tantara-bobus make shift!"
Matthew would say, morning, noon, and night, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the poor would be uttering their plaints in his ears;
and the whimsical saying, together with the jolly old
fellow's way of uttering it, many a time turned the
mourning of his neighbours into mirth.</p>

<p>One day, a stranger heard this singular saying, as
he was journeying through the town, and passing by
the street end of the alley where Matthew was leaning
on his two sticks to take the evening air, and chatting
with his neighbours, according to his custom. The
traveller could not fail to be struck with the saying,
for he had heard it before; and he had seen the
veteran who uttered it before, though it was many a
long year since. The traveller stopped, and gazed on
the old sailor for a moment or two, and then stretched
out his aged hand&mdash;for he, too, was an old man&mdash;to
grasp the hand of his ancient friend.</p>

<p>"Matthew Hardcastle! what, old Matthew!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Matthew stared, and seemed at a loss for a few
seconds; but, at length, he let one stick fall, as it
were mechanically, and, clasping his old friend's hand
with the hearty gripe of a true sailor, cried aloud,
while the fire of his youth seemed once more to
gleam from his eyes,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! Paul Perkins! God bless thy heart!
Why, I thought&mdash;but God bless thy heart and soul,
how art thou?&mdash;I thought thou hadst gone to Davy's
locker ten or fifteen years ago!"</p>

<p>"And I little thought that ever these old eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
again to look upon Matthew Hardcastle," replied
Paul; "why, Lord save us, you must be an amazing
age! I am nearly threescore and ten, but you were
a man in your prime when I was but little older than
a child, you know."</p>

<p>"Butter your shirt, sing tantara-bobus make
shift!" answered jolly old Matthew; "what matters
it how old one may be? We shall live till we die&mdash;kill
us that dare!" And the pair of sound-hearted
old tars burst into a merry laugh that came up so
clearly from the well-spring of their hearts as to
create a kindred merriment through the curious crowd,
which had by this time begun to gather round them,
in the narrow street.</p>

<p>"Well, but come, shipmate, this must not be a
dry meeting," said Paul; "suppose we step into the
Red Lion, or the Black Horse, that I see on the
signs here, hard by, and wet our whistles together,
once more. It may be for the last time, you know,
in this world."</p>

<p>"Avast, heaving!" replied Matthew; "I have no
objection for Molly Crabtree, here, to fetch us a jack
of rum or so, and we can have it in my little berth;
but my old head won't bear the racket of a public-house
now, Paul."</p>

<p>"Well, well, have it your own way, Mat," replied
the other; and the two ancient men adjourned,
as fast as their stiffened limbs would permit them, to
Matthew's little dwelling in the alley.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>Matthew's hammock&mdash;for he could never be persuaded
to sleep in a bed&mdash;was slung at one corner of
the narrow room, and just under it was placed his
arm-chair. He would fain have given up his usual
seat, on this occasion, to his friend; but Paul Perkins
had too much real and untaught courtesy to accept
of it.</p>

<p>"No, no, keep on board your own ship, Matthew,"
he cried; "I won't do any such thing: sit ye down,
sit ye down."</p>

<p>And so Matthew sat down, with this entreaty,
and reared his two sticks against the wall, and doffed
his rare hat, and showed his wig in all its glory.
Paul looked round the room, and could not help
indulging in the natural exultation of a sailor. Nelson,
and Howe, and Duncan, and Rodney, showed their
gallant faces, according to the best skill of some humble
limner, over the little mantelpiece: a fine model of a
first-rate man-of-war&mdash;the work of Matthew's own
fingers in his younger days&mdash;stood, in unapproachable
pride, upon a little dresser on the opposite side
of the dwelling; and, above it, a curious tobacco-pipe,
from some foreign shore, curled its enormous length
around three or four nails driven into the wall, and
displayed the painted image of a black-a-moor's head,
at its extremity. Other odd fragments of a sailor's
fondness, such as small carved "figure-heads" of
vessels, wrought with the pocket-knife, to relieve
hours of tedium, pouches of kangaroo-skin, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
favourite repositories of the sailor's favourite weed,
pipe-stoppers of bone, cut into grotesque shapes,
and such-like nick-knackeries decorated the walls,
till scarcely a bare patch of them could be seen.</p>

<p>"Well, and I suppose you're at home here, Mat,
eh?" said Paul, his face beaming with pleasure as he
asked the question.</p>

<p>A sudden and unwonted shade came over Matthew's
countenance: "Hum!" said he, gloomily, "liked
the old Dreadnought better; but she's now&mdash;God
bless her!&mdash;only a hull, like me. But butter your
shirt!" cried the gallant-hearted old fellow, bursting
into his prevailing gaiety,&mdash;"sing tantara-bobus make
shift! we shall live till we die&mdash;kill us that dare!"
And again the old lads set up a merry laugh in unison,
and were as happy, for the nonce, as the proudest
monarchs in christendom.</p>

<p>Molly Crabtree now entered with the rum, and
began to prepare the grog, that real nectar for the
sailor. The precious glass was mixed, and went round
over and over again; nor would the old sailors be said
"nay" when Molly looked modest about it: she was
compelled to take a sip each time when it came to her
turn. Old shipmates were named, and the bravery
and virtues of the dead were honoured; hearty and
kind wishes for the welfare of the living were expressed;
old stories were told, and the joys of old
times were recorded with a sigh; but sighing usually
was followed by a laugh amid the utterance of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Matthew's singular expletive, "Butter your shirt!
sing tantara-bobus make shift!"</p>

<p>"Upon my honour, Mat," at length said Paul,
for, as it began to grow towards midnight, the phraseology
of the ancient mariners began to grow more consequential,&mdash;more
by token that the "jack" of rum
had now been repeated, for the third time&mdash;"upon
my honour, Mat, you and I were no skinkers in that
hot action when you first wore the buttered shirt."</p>

<p>"Why, Lord ha' marcy on us!" cried Molly
Crabtree, who had been listening all along, and
staring like an owl at twilight, during the successive
strange recitals of the two old seafarers,&mdash;"did
Matthew ever wear a real buttered shirt, then? For
Heaven's sake tell us the meaning on't!"</p>

<p>"That I will, ma'am," said Paul touching his hat
as gallantly as an admiral; "you see, it was during
a severe engagement with the Dutchmen that
Mat and I were ordered to the main-top,&mdash;but
hardly had we reached it, when a shot from the
enemy cut our mainmast fairly in two, and hurled us
both on to the enemy's deck, in the midst of more than
a hundred heavy-bottomed Dutchmen! To dream of
fighting against such odds, ma'am, you'll understand
was, of course, out of all question; so we quietly
walked our bodies, to the tune of 'donner and
blitzen,' down below, to become close prisoners under
hatches. Now it so happened, d'ye see, ma'am? that
the only fellow-prisoners we found in the hole where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
they crammed us were cheeses and queer big tubs;
and we felt a nat'ral sort of a curiosity to rummage
about the hole, when left in the dark by ourselves.
Clambering up some o' these huge tubs at one end
of the hole, we both lost footing together, and fell
head over heels into the midst of something that was
remarkably soft; and there we struggled, and
struggled hard, too,&mdash;but 'twas all in vain, we could
not flounder out,&mdash;and so were content to remain
closed on all sides up to the neck, with just our heads
bobbing out, and gasping for breath. Shiver my
timbers, if ever I was so pickled before or since!
At length the Dutchman was taken; and when some
of our lads made their way into the dark hole where
we were, we began to hail 'em."&mdash;"Dreadnought
a-hoy!" said Mat: "The Union Jack a-hoy!" said
I: "Who's there, in the devil's name?" cried one:
"Why that's old Mat Hardcastle's growl&mdash;where
the devil is he?" said first one of our lads and then
another. And, as sure as you're there, ma'am,"
continued Paul, growing more polite and gallant as
he proceeded, "what with one noise or another, it
wasn't until the lads had driven their marling-spikes
through almost every cask in the hole, that Mat and
I were discovered up to the neck in one of the Dutchmen's
big butter firkins. We were a good deal
ashamed, ma'am, o' course, being as how we were
soaked to the skin in the grease, for it warmed, as we
stuck in it; and no doubt by its melting, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
ha' been able to have got out of it without help, if we
had had to stay much longer before we had been
found. The worst of it was, we could not get time
to strip for some hours after, and this made us both
mighty uneasy, for many was the joke that was
passed upon us as to how we liked our buttered
shirts. But Mat's heart was always light, all his
life long; and he answered all who asked that saucy
question, just as he puts by all sorrow now, with
"Butter <i>your</i> shirt! Sing tantarara-bobus make
shift!&mdash;and ever since then Matthew has kept his
saying; and it is not a bad one, either, let me tell
you, ma'am! what think ye?" concluded Paul
Perkins, and took a stiffer pull at the grog than he
had ever done that night, thinking that he deserved
it for his cleverness, and feeling himself entitled to
a double pull because he had missed his turn by
telling this yarn.</p>

<p>Molly Crabtree only answered with a hearty laugh,
and Paul laughed too, but Matthew laughed louder
and longer than either of them, for he was 'a practised
laugher, and lived by it,' as he used jokingly to say.
But now the fourth measure of grog was done, and
it was too late to buy more; so the conversation
began to grow less boisterous. Molly rose to depart;
and the two veterans were left by themselves. Paul
urged Matthew to get into his hammock, and Matthew
urged Paul; but neither could prevail on the
other, and so at last they fairly fell asleep in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
chairs, and neither of them awoke,&mdash;though they each
snored as loud as a rhinoceros,&mdash;until Molly Crabtree
came and opened the shutters some hours after sunrise
the ensuing morning. Their limbs were tolerably
stiff, and their heads ached beyond a joke, it may
easily be guessed, for it was many a long day since
either of them had gone to sleep groggy. They
made the best of their aches and pains, however,
when they awoke, and, after a hearty renewed gripe
of friendship, thrust each a lumping quid of tobacco
into his mouth, and then quietly awaited the preparation
of breakfast by Molly Crabtree.</p>

<p>Now, as natural as our forefathers always reckoned
it to be to get drunk, or, at least, tipsy, with an
old friend, when you met him after a long absence
or separation, yet it was always felt to be not less
natural that the cosy companions of the preceding
night talked like sober men the next morning. So
it was with Matthew Hardcastle and Paul Perkins.</p>

<p>"Matthew,&mdash;I've been thinking," began Paul,
very measuredly, as he was sipping the cocoa-sop out
of a bright brown earthen porringer, with a spoon, in
imitation of his host,&mdash;"I've been thinking,&mdash;we
shall soon be in our last port."</p>

<p>"True, very true," said Matthew, "and, d'ye know,
Paul? I would not much care if we had the same
voyage to go again, save and except a little at the
end on't."</p>

<p>"Then we don't think alike," said Paul, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
his spoon into the porringer, and looking thoughtful:
"I'm sure, Mat, you'll bear me witness that I'm no
skinkerly coward; but, splice me, if I don't think
that all this warring and fighting, and blowing up of
poor men's limbs is, after all, a great piece of wickedness.
And, besides that, I've thought very much
of late,&mdash;and particularly since I've seen the times
change so much,&mdash;that this setting of poor Englishmen
on to fight poor foreigners, and poor foreigners
to fight poor Englishmen, is only a deep scheme, on
the part of the rich abroad and the rich at home, to
keep the poor down."</p>

<p>"Say you so, Paul?" exclaimed Matthew, also
resting his spoon on the brim of the porringer, and
looking very intently upon his friend; "why, you
know, Paul, if we had not gone to fight the foreigners,
they would have come to fight us."</p>

<p>"But who amongst 'em was it that wanted to
fight? just think of that, Matthew," rejoined Paul,
very earnestly. "You and I had no quarrel with the
French, or the Dutch, or the Spaniard, you know.
And what poor foreigners, think you, had any quarrel
with the people here? No, no, depend on it,
Matthew, the poor never made these wars, nor ever
thought of fighting, or wished to fight, on either
side: it was the rich&mdash;'our betters,' as they are
called&mdash;who began the quarrel, and then pushed us,
or dragged us, into it, to lose our limbs, or shed our
blood, or escape if we could."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"'Pon my word," said Matthew, shaking his wig,
very significantly, "I've had some such thoughts as
these now and then,&mdash;and you're making a strong
yarn on't, Paul, I confess,&mdash;but what's the use of
muddling one's old brains with such things? You
know what I always say, Paul,&mdash;'Butter your
shirt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, but avast a bit, Mat," said Paul, looking
invincibly serious; "we are getting fast into our
last port, as I said before; and, if we have been unthinking
fools all our lives, I don't see why we
should not open our eyes and look about us a bit,
before we step on the last shore. Times are harder
now than ever you and I knew 'em; and, as much
fuss as there used to be made about an old seaman,
all that sort of thing is gone. I question if you
and I live a few years longer, and grow cranky,&mdash;and,
God knows, I begin to feel queer, night and
morning,&mdash;but folks will grow weary of waiting on us,
and the parish wolves will haul us away to the workhouse,
and pocket our little pensions."</p>

<p>"God Almighty forbid!" ejaculated Matthew,
very fervently.</p>

<p>"But 'tis very likely to come to pass, however, let
me tell you," rejoined Paul; "you knew Jerry
Simpson: he was berthsman with us, if you remember,
and lost an arm at Trafalgar. He wouldn't
go into Greenwich college, but went and settled in
Shoreditch, with his old sister. She died two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
twelvemonths ago, and poor old Jerry soon grew
helpless&mdash;so they took him into the parish poor-house,
pocketing his pension, and he died there, of
sheer grief, about six months ago. That was a rum
reward for fighting for his country so bravely as
Jerry did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By G&mdash;d it was!" exclaimed old Matthew,
involuntarily&mdash;for the fine old fellow had not uttered
an oath for years before: "the Lord ha' mercy
upon me for swearing, poor old sinner that I am!"
he continued:&mdash;"but you don't say that that's true
about Jerry Simpson, do you, Paul? why he used
to rush into a gun-boat like a ravenous wolf!
Shiver my old timbers! but a braver sailor than
Jerry never stepped upon deck!"</p>

<p>"'Pon the word of a sailor, what I have said is
true," replied Paul, "for I saw it with my own
sorrowful eyes. But now don't you perceive, Matthew,"
resumed Paul, eager to take advantage of the
impression this fact had made, "that the change in
the state of things is owing to the heavy taxes caused
by the war, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Paul, I don't understand these
things," said Matthew, impatiently; "but I feel
you are right about us poor dogs never wishing to
bite the foreigners&mdash;for I never had such a thought
till I got on board ship. But why is it that great
folks wish to shed blood at such a rate? What do
they want, and what would they have? 'Zounds!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
if I have but my bit o' bacco, and can rest at night,
I'm as happy as any of 'em. And then, again, Paul,
why is it&mdash;excuse me, Paul, if I seem to talk
foolish; I'm older than you, but you always had
more book larning, I'm well aware&mdash;why is it that
the poor don't let the rich fight their battles themselves,
if they want any fighting?"</p>

<p>"Why, there, now, you old billy-goat!" exclaimed
Paul, laughing; "you know that both you
and I were dragged off by the press-gang, just as we
were about to step on shore at Wapping; and were
not thousands hauled away, in the same manner,
throughout the war? 'Why is it that we don't let
'em fight their own battles themselves' indeed! why,
you know, Mat, the poor dogs are compelled to obey
the rich ones, in this world. What I want you to see
is that the rich dogs make these wars on purpose to
keep the poor dogs under. And yet I don't know,
Matthew, that either you or I can alter things: it is
past our time o' life; and, besides, I believe the
whole consarn will before long tumble to pieces of
itself, for the world's about tired of it."</p>

<p>"Blow me!" exclaimed Matthew, completely wearied
of the subject, and anxious to resume his usual
careless and happy vein, "if I can see the use of all
your palaver, Paul: you may be right, in the main,
but then you make no sail, take as many tacks as you
will. You still end by saying the poor dogs are
forced to bark and bite as the rich dogs bid 'em;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and you own that we're both too old to do aught
towards bettering things; and, besides, you say the
consarn's doomed to fall to pieces by its own rottenness;
and so, instead of bothering my old brains
about it, I still say, as I did when we got out of the
Dutchmen's firkin, 'Butter your shirt! sing tantarara-bobus
make shift!'"</p>

<p>The argument was ended with a hearty laugh on
both sides, for, as toughly as Paul had spun his yarn,
it was clear, from his last observation, that he was
beginning to esteem his work as "labour in vain."
That day and another passed in calling old times to
mind; and, on the fourth day, the two ancient
friends and fellows in many a storm and broil,
parted, never to meet again on the lee-shore of
Time.</p>

<p>Old Matthew Hardcastle kept up his gaiety of
heart till his last day, though that day was, to the
full, as doleful as his trusty friend Paul Perkins had
prognosticated it would be. Reader,&mdash;if ever it
falls in your way to visit old Gainsbro', you will
learn that, in the main, what I am about to relate is
too true. In proportion as Matthew became helpless,
people were wearied with waiting upon him;
and, disgraceful to relate! the old warrior-seaman
was, at length, neglected till his aged body swarmed
with filth. Instead of respect, disgust was now expressed
for him, by an unreasonable world. Paul
Perkins' prophecy came true to the letter: the parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
"worthies" came to "take care of him;" they took
him to the poor-house; he was stripped stark-naked
in the wash-house; and cold water was "swabbed,"
as he himself would have said, upon his aged body
to cleanse him! Even in that moment, the brave
companion of Howe and Nelson strove to keep up
the gaiety of his noble heart, and once essayed his old
saying, "Butter your shirt! sing"&mdash;&mdash;But his aged
lips quivered, and his jaws chattered with the cold,&mdash;and
his bold old heart broke with the barbarous
treatment he was undergoing!</p>

<p>Oh! this is a world of wrong; and it will take
a great deal of effort to right it, if ever it be righted
at all. Reader! if you even think, with Paul
Perkins, that the bad system under which so many
groan, will, at length, fall to pieces by virtue, or
rather by the vice, of its own imperfections,&mdash;is it
not, still, sensible and philanthropic to be doing what
little we can to hasten what we feel to be "a consummation
devoutly to be wished?"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>DOROTHY PYECROFT'S PREACHING;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All the world, in the village of Sturton-le-Steeple,
had said so, before the time of old Dorothy Pyecroft;
but Dorothy did not join all the world in saying so.
Sturton is a homely little place, situate in the pleasant
shire of Nottingham, and lying within a couple
of miles of the Trent, and old Lincolnshire; and
its church steeple forms a pretty object in the landscape
which you view from the hills above Gainsboro'.
Dorothy Pyecroft, from the time that she was a child
but the height of a table, went to Gainsboro' market
with butter, eggs, or poultry, as regularly as Tuesday
returned in each week; for the hearty old dame used
commonly to boast that she had never known what
it was to have a day's illness in her life, although, at
the season we are beginning to gossip about, she was
full threescore and ten. It was a bonny sight to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the dame go tripping o'er the charming lea which
spreads its flowery riches from Sturton-le-Steeple to
the banks of noble Trent, by four of the clock on a
gay summer's morning, with the clean milking-pail
under her arm, that was bare to the elbow. You
would have thought, at a distance, she had been
some blithe maiden in her teens. And then the
cheerful and clear tone in which she summoned her
cows, calling to them as kindly as if they were her
children&mdash;"Come, my pratty creatures!" a call that
was the signal for a treat of pleasing pastoral music
to the enthusiastic early angler on the Trent: the
rich, varied "low" of the cows,&mdash;alto, tenor, and
bass,&mdash;answered that call, in changeful echo across
the stream; the angler's delighted ear caught a
treble, heavenward, from the matin lark, to complete
the "harmony;" and even the cackling of the geese,
uttering their confused joy at the sound of the dame's
voice, seemed to mingle no unpleasing "discord"
with the natural chorus. By the time that her
morning's milking was over, the spoilt maidens of
the village were only beginning to open their kitchen
window-shutters; and she usually passed the whole
train of them, loitering and chattering about their
sweethearts, on their way to the lea, as she returned
home, with the rich load upon her head, and her
arms fixed as properly a-kimbo as could be shown by
the sprightliest lass that ever carried a milking-pail.
Some little shame was commonly felt among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
loiterers as they passed the exemplary old woman,&mdash;but
it did not result in their reformation. Old
Farmer Muxloe, who was always abroad at daybreak,
and usually chatted a few moments with the
dame just at the point where the footpath crossed
the bridle-way over the lea, often commented, in no
very measured terms, on the decline of discipline
among milk-maids since the days when he was a
lad.</p>

<p>"Ah, dame!" he used to say, "there have been
sore changes since you and I used to take a turn
around the maypole; I'm sure the world gets lazier
and lazier every day."</p>

<p>"Why, you see, neighbour, fashions change," the
old dame would reply&mdash;for she ever loved to take the
more charitable side of a question; "maybe, things
may change again, and folk may take to getting up
earlier, after a few more years are over."</p>

<p>"I'faith, I've little hope on't," the old farmer
would reply, and shake his head, and smile; "but
there's nobody like thee, Dolly, for taking the kindest
side."</p>

<p>"Why, neighbour, I always think it the best,"
Dorothy would rejoin, with a benevolent smile; "I
never saw things grow better by harsh words and
harsh thinkings, in my time."</p>

<p>And then the old farmer would smile again, and
say, "Well, well, that's just like thee! God bless
thee, Dolly, and good morning to thee!" and away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
he would turn Dobbin's head, and proceed on his
usual morning's ride from field to field.</p>

<p>The work of her little dairy, added to the care of
a humble household, composed of an infirm and helpless
husband, and an equally infirm maiden sister,&mdash;with,
all and sundry, a stout house-dog, two tabby-cats,
and a fruitful poultry-yard,&mdash;usually occupied
Dorothy Pyecroft through the bustling forenoon of
each day; and when there was no immediate call
upon her skill and benevolence among sick neighbours,&mdash;for
she was the cleverest herb-woman in
the village, and exercised her knowledge of the
healing art without fee, or willing acceptance even of
thanks,&mdash;she would sit in her polished high-backed
chair, and work through the livelong afternoon at
her spinning-wheel, drowsing her two infirm companions
into a salutary rest and forgetfulness with the
humming monotony of her labour, but revolving
within her own mind many a useful and solemn
thought, meanwhile.</p>

<p>Dorothy sat absorbed in this her favourite employ,
one afternoon in autumn, when an itinerant pedlar
made his customary call at the cottage-door. The
dame's mind was so deeply involved in the contrivance
of one of her little plans of benevolence, that
she did not recognise the face of the traveller until
he had addressed her twice.</p>

<p>"Any small wares for children? any needles, pins,
or thimbles?" cried the pedlar, running through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
list of his articles with the glibness of frequent repetition.</p>

<p>"No, Jonah: I want none," replied the dame,
kindly; "but, maybe, you'll take a horn o' beer, and
a crumb or two o' bread and cheese?"</p>

<p>The pedlar assented, well pleased, and lowered
the pack from his shoulders, and set down the basket
from his hand, next seating himself in a chair without
the ceremonial of asking, and in all the gladsome
confidence of welcome.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, dame," he said, and
smacked his lips with pleasurable anticipation, as he
took the horn of smiling beer and the piece of bread
and cheese from the dame's hand.</p>

<p>"You're welcome, Jonah," replied the dame,
heartily. "Have you walked far to-day? and what
luck have you had?"</p>

<p>"I've come twenty miles, and have never taken
handsel yet, dame," answered Jonah, in a melancholy
tone.</p>

<p>"So, poor heart!" said Dorothy, very pitifully;
"I must buy a trifling dozen of needles of thee,
however, before thou goest. I fear times are hard,
Jonah: I hear many and grievous complaints."</p>

<p>"Times are harder than ever I knew them to be,
dame, I assure you," rejoined Jonah; "and they
that have a little money seem most determined to
hold it fast. Sore murmurings are made about this
by poor folk: but I don't wonder at it, myself," concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the worldly pedlar, "for, in such sore times
as these, there's no knowing what a body may come
to want: and, as the old saying goes, you know,
dame, 'Charity begins at home!'"&mdash;and Jonah buried
his nose in the ale-horn, thinking he had said something
so wisely conclusive that it could not be contradicted.</p>

<p>"They say it was a parson who first used that
saying," observed Dorothy, glancing from her wheel,
very keenly, towards the pedlar; "but, for my part,
Jonah, I am very far from thinking it such a saying
as a parson ought to use."</p>

<p>"Say you, dame?" said Jonah, opening his eyes
very wide.</p>

<p>"Did charity begin at home with their master?"
said Dorothy, by way of explanation.</p>

<p>"Ah, dame!" said the pedlar, quickly discerning
Dorothy's meaning, "I fear but few parsons think
of imitating their master now-a-days!"</p>

<p>"That's more than I like to say," observed the
gentle Dorothy; "I think there are more good
people in the world than some folk think for;&mdash;but
I'm sure, Jonah, we all want a better understanding
of our duty towards each other."</p>

<p>"Right, Dame Dorothy, right!&mdash;that's the best
sort of religion; but there's the least of it in this
world," rejoined the pedlar.</p>

<p>"Why, Jonah," continued the good dame, "I
think there might easily be a great deal more good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
in the world than there is. Every body ought to
remember how many little kindnesses it is in their
power to perform for others, without any hurt to
themselves."</p>

<p>"Yes, a sight o'good might be done in that way,
dame," observed the pedlar, beginning very much to
admire Dorothy's remarks; "and how much more
happy the world would be then!"</p>

<p>"Just so!" exclaimed Dorothy, her aged face
beaming with benevolence; "that is the true way
of making the world happy, for all to be trying to
do their fellow-creatures some kindness. And then,
you see, Jonah, when once the pleasure of thus acting
began to be felt, there would soon be a pretty general
willingness to make greater efforts, and even
sacrifices of self-interest, as it is wrongly called, in
order to experience greater pleasure, and likewise to
increase the world's happiness."</p>

<p>"Truly, dame," said the pedlar, "you do me good
to hear you talk. I'm but a poor scholar; yet I can
tell, without book, that you must be right."</p>

<p>"But then, you see, Jonah," continued the dame,
half unconscious of Jonah's last observation, "if
every body were to say, 'Charity begins at home,'
this general happiness would never begin. I like
best, Jonah, to think of the example of the Blessed
Being who came into the world to do us all good.
He went about pitying the miserable and afflicted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
and healing and blessing them. Charity did not
begin at home with him, Jonah!"</p>

<p>The tears were now hastening down Jonah's rough
cheeks. How forcible are lessons of goodness! how
irresistibly the heart owns their power! Jonah could
not support the conversation further. Dorothy's plain
and unaffected remarks sunk deep in to his bosom; and
when he rose up, and buckled on his pack once more,
and the aged dame gave him "handsel," or first
money for the day, by purchasing a few pins and
needles, the poor pedlar bade her farewell in an
accent that showed he felt more than common thankfulness
for her kindness.</p>

<p>Alas! this is a world where good impressions are,
too often, speedily effaced by bad ones. Jonah called,
next at the gate of a wealthy squire, and, with hat
in hand, asked for leave to go up to the kitchen-door
and expose his wares to the servants. The squire
refused; and when Jonah pleaded his poverty, and
ventured to remonstrate, the squire frowningly
threatened to set the dogs upon him, if he did not
instantly decamp! Jonah turned away, and bitterly
cursed the unfeeling heart of the rich man,&mdash;avowing,
internally, that Dorothy Pyecroft was only a
doating old fool,&mdash;for, after all, "Charity begun at
home!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had the pedlar taken twenty steps from
Dame Dorothy's cottage, ere the village clergyman
knocked at her door. The dame knew the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
parson's "rap-rap-rap!" It was quick and consequential,
and unlike the way of knocking at a door
used by any one else in Sturton, who thought it necessary
to be so ceremonious as to give notice before
they entered their neighbour's dwelling. Dame Dorothy
ceased her spinning, and rose to open the door,
curtesying with natural politeness, and inviting her
visitor to be seated.</p>

<p>"Thank ye!" said the parson, raising his brows
superciliously, putting the hook-end of his hunting-whip
to his mouth, and striding about the floor in his
spurred boots; "sit you down, I beg, Dame Pyecroft!
sit you down&mdash;I'll not sit, thank ye!"</p>

<p>"I fear, sir, there is a great deal of suffering at
present," said Dorothy, sitting down, and fixing her
mild blue eyes upon the thoughtless young coxcomb,
and feeling too earnestly in love with goodness to
lose any opportunity of recommending its glorious
lessons.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;suffering!&mdash;ay!" observed the young
clergyman, in a tone that showed he did not know
what it was to think seriously: "you know there
always was a difference between the rich and the
poor."</p>

<p>"But do you not think, sir, that the rich might
lessen the difference between themselves and the
poor, without injuring themselves?" asked Dorothy,
in a tone of mild but firm expostulation.</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, I can't say exactly," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the parson, apparently brought to a halt in his
thoughtlessness, and unable to extricate himself from
the difficulty in which his ignorance placed him; "I
can't say exactly; but, you know, Dame Pyecroft,
some people have nothing to give away, though they
may be better off than many of the poor: with such
people, you know, Dame Pyecroft, the old proverb
holds good, that 'Charity begins at home.'"</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear <i>you</i> quote that proverb,
sir," said Dorothy; "I had just been exerting my poor
wits to show that that saying was not a right one, in
the hearing of poor Jonah the pedlar, before your
reverence came in."</p>

<p>"Not a right saying, Dame Pyecroft? Why, you
know it is a very old-established saying; and I think
it a very shrewd one," rejoined the clergyman.</p>

<p>"But it is not so old as the New Testament, sir,"
replied Dorothy, with a winning smile; "and as
shrewd as it is, do you think, sir, it was ever acted
upon by your Great Master?"</p>

<p>The young clergyman took his hook-whip from his
mouth, laid it on the table, took out his pocket-handkerchief,
and, blushing up to the eyes, sat down
before he attempted an answer to the good old dame's
meek but powerful question.</p>

<p>"You will remember, Dame Dorothy," he said,
at length, "that the Saviour was in very different
circumstances to all other human beings that ever
lived."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"But you will remember, sir," rejoined Dorothy,
in the same mildly pertinacious manner, "that that
Blessed Being said to his disciples, 'I have given
you an example, that ye shall do as I have done to
you: if I have washed your feet, ye ought also to
wash one another's feet.'"</p>

<p>"Yes: that is very beautiful," said the young
clergyman, feeling the irresistible force of goodness,
and speaking as if he had never read the passage in
the book for himself: "the Saviour's example is
very beautiful."</p>

<p>"And does not your reverence perceive how easy
and delightful it would be for every one to begin to
follow it?" immediately rejoined Dorothy, taking
advantage of the good impression which, she saw, was
being made on the mind of the young parson; "how
easily might all who have enough give even of their
little superfluity; how easily might we all do each
other kindnesses which would cost us nothing! What
solid pleasure this would bring back upon each of
our hearts; and how surely it would lead us to make
sacrifices, in order to experience the richer pleasure
of doing greater good! Oh, sir," concluded the
good old creature, with a tear that an angel might
envy gliding down her aged and benevolent cheek,
"I cannot think that any one knows the secret of
true happiness who practises the precept&mdash;'Charity
begins at home!'"</p>

<p>The young and inexperienced man gazed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
strange expression at his new and humble teacher.
This was better preaching than he had ever heard
or practised. His heart had been misled, but not
thoroughly vitiated, by a selfish and falsely styled
"respectable" education. He was too much affected
to prolong the conversation then; but he became,
from that time, a pupil at the feet of the aged Dorothy.
His fine manners were laid aside. He became a real
pastor. He was, from that day, more frequently in
the cottages of the poor, twenty times over, than in
the houses of the rich. He distributed of his substance
to relieve the wants of others, and lived himself
upon little. He forgot creeds to preach goodness,
and pity, and mercy, and love. He preached
till he wept, and his audiences wept with him. His
life was an embodiment of the virtues he inculcated.
And when, in the course of five short years, he laid
down his body in the grave, a victim to the earnest
conviction of his mind, the poor crowded around
his hallowed resting-place with streaming eyes, and
loving, but afflicted hearts, wishing they might be
where he was when they died, since they were sure
his presence, they said, of itself would make a
heaven!</p>

<p>The young clergyman interred Dorothy Pyecroft
but half a year before his own departure; and her
last words were words of thankfulness that ever she
had shown the young man the fallacy of the proverb&mdash;"Charity
begins at home."</p>

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
MINISTER OF MERCY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Leicester has the appearance of a new town as you
glance at it, in your rapid course on the Midland
Counties Railway. And, if the "locomotives" halt
for a few minutes at a point on the line where you have
a full view of the goodly borough, the momentary
impression which numerous ancient church-towers
gives you of the real antiquity of the place is soon
effaced by the extensive rows of newly-built houses
that stretch away on every side till they appear to
cover almost the entire populous area on which you
are gazing. Successive gusts of prosperity for
the manufacturers, occurring at various periods
during the last forty years,&mdash;too often followed by
severe depressions,&mdash;have in fact swelled the town
to more than double its size at the close of the last
century.</p>

<p>Yet a few days' sojourn in the borough would
afford a lover of antiquity no inferior treat. The
massive wall and arched vaults of a ruin, believed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
have formed part of a temple of Janus during the
ages that Britain was under Roman sway,&mdash;the
ivied remains of the noble abbey where the imperious
and vice-regal Wolsey "laid his bones,"&mdash;the
sternly frowning "Newarke," or entrance-tower
to the castle of the Grantmesnels, Bellomonts,
Blanchmaines, De Montforts, Plantagenets, and other
proud Earls of Leicester,&mdash;the solitary wooded
mound on which the castle itself anciently stood,&mdash;the
rich minute carving of the old churches,&mdash;the
quaint interior of the old town-hall,&mdash;the grotesque
exterior of much of the really ancient part of the
town, composed of dwellings striped with timber
and plaster, and decked with ornamented or overhanging
gables,&mdash;dwellings wherein the soldiers of
the fated kingly Crookt-back were billeted on the
night before Bosworth-field,&mdash;these, and sundry
other features of historic chronicle and change, could
not fail to awaken eager interest in an antiquarian.
Our story, however, concerns itself less with the
outward than the inward, and regards rather the
misery of the living than the pride of the dead.</p>

<p>Passing along the ancient line of highway from
York to London, from the churchless burial-yard of
St. Leonard, over the old North bridge, revealing
the meandering Soar and the meadows of the old
monks; by the curious Gothic west-door of the very
ancient church of All Saints, that almost compels
you to stop and look at it; and then, by the transverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
streets, where the venerable "high cross" was
taken down but a few years ago, and reaching that
part of the ancient principal line of street called
"Southgate," where modern Goths so lately took
down that most interesting historical relic, the house
in which the last regal Plantagenet slept the night
before his death; (a splendid gable filled with a
world of old English associations, and breathing a
wholesome lesson to despotism from every atom of
its mouldering substance!) the traveller would come
to a ruinous-looking entry of a street on his right,
bearing the chivalrous designation of "Red Cross
Street." At the door of a low, crumbling house
about halfway down this ancient bye-street, a dissenting
minister stopped one winter's evening some
eight-and-twenty years ago, to make his usual call
of duty and benevolence. His gentle knock, however,
was not answered; and, before he could repeat
it, he was saluted hastily by a rich manufacturer,
a member of his congregation, who was passing by
on some business errand.</p>

<p>"You are the very man I wanted to see," said
the minister in a very earnest tone, seizing the
manufacturer by one arm, as if he feared the man
of business might feel disposed to escape him: "I
want half an hour's conversation with you, sir."</p>

<p>"But I cannot stay now, sir," replied the manufacturer;
"will you join me in my morning ride in
the gig to-morrow? Do, sir; it will do you good."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, I will; thank you, sir," answered the
minister, in a quick, nervous way that seemed to be
usual with him; and they shook hands with great
apparent fervour, and bid each other "good night."</p>

<p>The dissenting minister did not find entrance
into the low, ruined-looking house, until a neighbour
or two had forced open the door. A light was
then brought, and a picture of affecting interest was
revealed. A venerable silver-haired man lay breathing
his last; and by the side of his humble bed, with
folded hands, knelt she who had been the partaker of
his joys and sorrows for sixty years, lost to all consciousness
except that of mental prayer for her departing
husband. The sound of the minister's voice
seemed to arouse her for a moment; but she relapsed
again into complete obliviousness of all things, save
the one absorbing feeling created by the view of that
gasping pallid form that lay before her. So the
minister knelt, likewise; and when the neighbours
who had entered with him had followed his example
he prayed audibly and earnestly, yet so reverently
and pathetically, that, while he prayed and wept,
the neighbours thought themselves in the presence of
some superior being, with a soul of compass to embrace
and bless the whole human race, rather than
a mere mortal. The face of the dying man kindled,
too, with wondrous feeling, when he heard the
sounds of that well-known and beloved voice, though
he had seemed past consciousness but a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
before. And when the minister paused in his petition,
and saw the aged man's look fixed upon him, he
said, with unutterable sweetness and tenderness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"William, my dear old friend, is all well within?&mdash;is
your hope still blooming and full of immortality?"</p>

<p>The aged man raised his withered right hand with
a last effort&mdash;waved it thrice&mdash;smiled with an ineffable
smile,&mdash;and expired!</p>

<p>The minister was raising the aged and speechless
widow from her kneeling posture, and placing her in
an arm-chair, when her married daughter and several
other neighbours entered the house of death. The
minister recognised the daughter, and, after committing
the widow earnestly to her care, emptied his
waistcoat pocket of the silver it contained, and gave
it, without counting, into the hands of the astonished
young woman, who stood staring, while the good
man snatched up his hat, and, saying "God bless
you all! I'll call again to-morrow: God bless you
all!" hurried away in a moment.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A tall, grave-looking man, in the habit of a
gentleman, bowed courteously to the dissenting minister,
as he was turning the corner of the High
Street, and, addressing him by his name, uttered
the customary observations on the severity of the
weather.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir," spake the dissenting minister,
unable, from the state of his feelings, to answer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the same strain, "I wish I had had you with me a
quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Why, sir?" asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>"That you might have seen, for yourself, how a
Christian can die," answered the minister.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the gentleman, with a look of serious
concern, "there you, and all truly Christian ministers,
find a field of more exalted enterprise than
the whole world of turmoil and strife, put together,
can furnish. I envy you, my dear sir&mdash;I envy you,
more than I can express to you."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, a field of exalted, of truly glorious
enterprise, the visiting of death-beds&mdash;the pouring
of heavenly consolation into the spirit that is
leaving its frail clay tabernacle, and the gladdening
of the human wretchedness which is left to mourn
and weep," burst forth the good minister, forgetting
that he stood in the bleak, cold, open street, and not
in his pulpit; "but, oh, my good friend, what a
dark, disconsolate scene would your Free-thinking
make of the chamber of death, were it as universally
spread as you wish it to be!"</p>

<p>"It is there where you always have the advantage
of me, sir," rejoined the gentleman; "I have acknowledged
it, again and again; and I feel the force
of that reflection so powerfully, sometimes, that I
half resolve to spend the remainder of my life in
some scheme of philanthropy, and, meanwhile, join
in persuading men to believe Christianity, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
I do not believe its historical evidences are worth a
straw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that would be wrong, sir!" said the minister
interrupting the other, very earnestly.</p>

<p>"So I think, sir," continued the gentleman; "and
yet I feel sometimes as if I should become guilty of
a crime by striving to take away what I regard as a
pleasant deceit from men,&mdash;their chance, by imbibing
a full confidence in Christianity, of expiring not
merely with calmness, but with rapturous joy and
triumph. Free-thinking will never enable even the
largest intellect, the most highly cultivated man, to
die thus; much less will it give such a death to an
imperfectly educated or ignorant man. But then, I
reflect again, that it would be morally and veritably
criminal in me to join in strengthening what I sincerely
believe to be falsehood."</p>

<p>"And so it would, sir," said the dissenting minister,
taking the gentleman's arm, who offered it,
that they might walk on to avoid some degree of the
cold; "so it would, sir: it would render you a very
contemptible creature. Let me tell you, sir, that
with all the delight I experience in fulfilling some
little of my duty as a Christian minister, the remembrance
of it would not move me one inch towards the
bed of a dying man with the view of offering him the
consolations of revealed religion&mdash;if I believed such
consolations to be a mere farce. I would scorn to
mock him with false hopes. You know how deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
I regret your scepticism, my dear sir; but I would
not see you veil it through a spurious tenderness.
No, sir: truth and sincerity are the purest jewels
in human character; even pity and benevolence,
themselves, are gems of inferior water."</p>

<p>"I wish all Christians were like yourself," said
the gentleman, after a pause of admiration for the
great and good being with whom he felt it a real privilege
to walk; "but I see so little practice of goodness
from the hundreds around me who profess a
religion that enthrones it, that the sight tends much
to confirm me in my old opinions."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," observed the minister, in a very
grave tone, "I must tell you that you will be guilty
of great self-deceit, if you imagine that the wickedness
of hypocrites, or the slackness of lukewarm
professors, will form a valid excuse for your rejection
of Christ's mission, should you, one day, prove it
true."</p>

<p>"I know it, my dear sir," replied the gentleman;
"I know it well; though I thank you for your kind
and well-meant zeal in reminding me of it. I will
tell you one thought of mine, however,&mdash;and it is
one that fixes itself very forcibly before my judgment,&mdash;if
callousness to the sufferings of their workmen
continues to increase among the manufacturers
as rapidly as it has increased for the last ten years,
Christianity will be openly scoffed at by the poor of
the next generation, in the very streets where we are
now walking."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"You have only expressed what I expressed last
Sunday morning from my own pulpit, sir," returned
the minister,&mdash;seeming too deeply affected with his
strong belief of the probability of such an event to be
able to add more.</p>

<p>"I hear that the wretched framework-knitters
suffer more and more from abatements of wages and
other encroachments upon their means of subsistence,
of the most unfeeling and unprincipled character,"
resumed the gentleman; "and although hundreds
are without work at the present time, and the complaints
of suffering from want of food, fuel, and
clothing, are so loud and frequent, yet not a single
rich manufacturer of the many that profess religion,
in Leicester, proposes to open a public subscription
for the poor, according to the humane custom of
past times. I heard a whisper that you had begun
to stir up the languid charity of some of your friends
towards the commencement of a subscription: was
I rightly informed, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is the very subject I intend to broach to Mr.&mdash;&mdash;,
to-morrow morning," replied the minister,
with an enthusiastic glow suffusing his expressive
face.</p>

<p>"Please place your own name for that sum somewhere
on the list," said the gentleman, taking a note
for 20<i>l.</i> out of his pocket-book and giving it to the
minister.</p>

<p>The good preacher was trying to stifle his grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
tears, in order to thank the sceptic,&mdash;but the
latter bowed and strode away; and the good preacher,
as he walked towards his own house in deep reflective
silence, had many thoughts of the true interpretation
of such words as "infidel" and "Christian" that
would have startled his audience, if he had uttered
them before it on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>In spite of an agonised bodily system, the minister
was early abroad the next morning, and his glorious
brow beamed with pleasure, when the maid-servant
announced that the rich manufacturer's gig was at the
door, and the conversation was near that he hoped
would result in the effective commencement of a subscription
to relieve the misery, and hunger, and cold,
and disease, under which the depressed stockingers
and their families were groaning that severe winter.
Yet the philanthropist, with all his guilelessness,
knew the man he had to deal with, and proceeded in a
somewhat circumlocutory way to his object. In the
end, he enforced the claims of man as a brother, the
admirableness and divinity of charity, and the indefeasible
rights of the working man as a substantial
agent in the creation of wealth, with so much of the
potentiality of his transcendent eloquence, that the
manufacturer, in spite of the resistance his heart's
avarice made to the godlike theme, assented to the
proposal that he should begin the public subscription.
But how heart-stricken with grief and shame did the
golden-tongued pleader feel when, on producing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
little book he had prepared for collecting the names
of subscribers, the rich manufacturer hesitated as
soon as he had written his name, bit the end of his
cedar pencil, and then hastily put five pounds at the
end of his name! The minister did not thank him,
for his soul was too noble to permit his tongue to
utter one word which his heart would not accompany:
but he had, again, some peculiar thoughts about the
true interpretation of the words "infidel" and
"Christian."</p>

<p>Neither was the good man to be damped by such
an inauspicious beginning; but begging Mr.&mdash;&mdash;would
not drive on again till he, the minister, had
got safely out of the gig, bid the rich churl "good
morning," posted away to the house of another "of
whom the world was not worthy," but with whom
Leicester was likewise blessed at that time: the
Rev. Mr. Robinson, vicar of St. Mary's, stayed till
that good man formed a little collecting book, and
then left him to divide the work of canvassing the
town for names to form the subscription list. Assisted
occasionally by others, the dissenting minister
persevered, till, in the lapse of several days, and at
the cost to himself of excruciating visitations of
increased pain in the night season, he completed such
a list as gave effectual relief to the hundreds of his
suffering fellow-creatures then inhabiting Leicester.</p>

<p>That labour was no sooner ended than he commenced
a close inquiry into the real state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
staple trade of the town; and, finding that the reports
of oppression and extortion, the foul fruits of avaricious
competition, were not exaggerated, he sat
down and wrote an appeal in behalf of the suffering
framework-knitters that might have jeopardied the
favour and acceptance of a less able preacher with
the wealthier members of his congregation.</p>

<p>It might be imprudent to go on: the starving
stockingers of Leicester have no longer such an advocate;
and, as highly as some profess to esteem the
memory of the truly good, they may feel angered by
this introduction of a portrait which, as imperfectly
as it is delineated, they will already have recognised
to their shame. If a stranger to old Leicester should
ask whose is the portrait this faint limning is intended
to call to memory, it is hoped it will not be deemed
an act of desecration to introduce, in a volume of
merely fugitive essays, a name too truly holy to be
lightly mentioned,&mdash;a name inscribed, ineffaceably,
in English literature, by the sunbeam of his peerless
and hallowed eloquence to whom it belonged,&mdash;the
name of <span class="smcap">Robert Hall</span>.</p>

<h2>"MERRIE ENGLAND"&mdash;NO MORE!</h2>
</div>

<p>The present generation,&mdash;the generation succeeding
that in which the eloquent philanthropist and
the sceptical gentleman lived and conversed,&mdash;has it
witnessed any verification of the serious prophecy
uttered in that winter evening's conversation in the
streets of Leicester? The following brief but truthful
sketch will furnish an answer.</p>

<p>On an April morning in forty-two&mdash;scarcely four
years bygone,&mdash;a group of five or six destitute-looking
men were standing on a well-known space
in Leicester, where the frustrum of a Roman milestone
(surmounted, in true Gothic style, with a fantastic
cross) was preserved within an iron palisade,
and where the long narrow avenue of Barkby Lane,
enters the wide trading street called Belgrave
Gate. The paleness and dejection of the men's
faces, as well as the ragged condition of their clothing,
would have told how fearfully they were struggling
with poverty and want, if their words had not
been overheard.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind the lad, John," said the tallest
and somewhat the hardest-featured man of the
party; "he can't be worse off than he would have
been at home, let him be where he will. What's
the use of grieving about him? He was tired of
pining at home, no doubt, and has gone to try if he
can't mend his luck. You'll hear of him again,
soon, from some quarter or other."</p>

<p>"But I can't satisfy myself about him, in that
way, George," replied the man to whom this rough
exhortation was addressed; "if the foolish lad be
drawn into company that tempts him to steal, I may
have to hear him sentenced to transportation, and
that would be no joke, George."</p>

<p>"I see nothing so very serious, even in that,"
observed another of the group; "I would as lief
be transported to-morrow as stay here to starve, as
I've done for the last six months."</p>

<p>"It would seem serious to me, though," rejoined
John, "to see my own child transported."</p>

<p>"Why, John, to men that scorn to steal, in
spite of starvation," resumed George, "it's painful
to see any child, or man either, transported: but
where's the real disgrace of it? The man that pronounces
the sentence is, in nine cases out of ten, a
bigger villain than him that's called 'the criminal.'
Disgrace is only a name&mdash;a mere name, you know,
John."</p>

<p>"I'm aware there's a good deal o' truth in that,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
replied John; "the names of things would be altered
a good deal, if the world was set right: but,
as wrong as things are now, yet I hope my lad
will never steal, and have to be sentenced to transportation.
I've often had to hear him cry for bread,
since he was born, and had none to give him:
but I would sooner see him perish with hunger than
live to hear him transported, for I think it would
break my heart;&mdash;and God Almighty forbid I ever
should have to hear it!"</p>

<p>"Goddle Mitey!" said George, pronouncing the
syllables in a mocking manner, and setting up a
bitter laugh, which was joined by every member of
the group, except the mournful man who had just
spoken; "who told thee there was one? Thy
grandmother and the parsons? Don't talk such
nonsense any more, John! it's time we all gave it
over: they've managed to grind men to the dust
with their priestcraft, and we shall never be righted
till we throw it off!"</p>

<p>"No, no," chimed in another, immediately; "they
may cant and prate about it: but, if their God existed,
he would never permit us to suffer as we do!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm come seriously to the same conclusion,"
said one who had not spoken before, and was
the palest and thinnest of the group: "I think all
their talk about a Providence that disposes the lot
of men differently here, 'for His Own great mysterious
purposes,' as they phrase it, is mere mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
humbug, to keep us quiet. What purpose
could a being have, who, they say, is as infinitely
good as he is infinitely powerful, in placing me where
I must undergo insult and starvation, while He
places that man,&mdash;the oppressor and grinder, who
is riding past now, in his gig,&mdash;in plenty and
abundance?"</p>

<p>"Right, Benjamin," said George; "they can't
get quit of their difficulty, quibble as they may: if
they bedaub us with such nicknames as 'Atheistical
Socialists,' we can defy them to make the riddle
plainer by their own Jonathan Edwards, that they
say good Robert Hall read over thirteen times,
and pronounced 'irrefragable.'"</p>

<p>"Just so," resumed Benjamin, "whether man be
called a 'Creature of Circumstance,' or a 'Creature
of Necessity,' it amounts to the same thing. And,
then, none of the Arminian sects can make out a
case: they only prove the same thing as the Calvinist
and the Socialist, when their blundering argument is
sifted to the bottom."</p>

<p>"So that, if there be a Providence," continued
George, "it has appointed, or permitted,&mdash;which
they like, for it comes to the same,&mdash;that old&mdash;&mdash;should
fling the three dozen hose in your face last
November, and that you should be out of work,
and pine ever since; it appointed that I should get
a few potatoes or a herring, by begging, or go
without food altogether, some days since Christmas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
and that each of us here, though we are willing to
work, should have to starve; while it appointed
that the mayor should live in a fine house, and swell
his riches, by charging <i>whole</i> frame-rents, month
after month, to scores of poor starving stockingers
that had from him but half week's work."</p>

<p>"And, with all their talk about piety," rejoined
Benjamin, "I think there is no piety at all in believing
in the existence of such a Providence: and
since, it appears, it can't be proved that Providence
is of any other character, if there be One at all, I
think it less impious to believe in None."</p>

<p>John stood by while this conversation was going
on; but he heard little of it,&mdash;for his heart was too
heavy with concern for his child,&mdash;and, in a little
time, he took his way, silently and slowly, towards
other groups of unemployed and equally destitute
men, who were standing on the wider space of ground,
at the junction of several streets,&mdash;a locality known
by the names of "the Coal-hill," and "the Hay-market,"
from the nature of the merchandise sold
there, at different periods, in the open air.</p>

<p>"Have you found the lad yet?" said one of John's
acquaintances, when he reached the outermost group.</p>

<p>"No, William," replied the downcast father;
"and I begin to have some very troublesome fears
about him, I'll assure you."</p>

<p>"But why should you, John?" expostulated the
other; "he's only gone to try if he can't mend himself&mdash;&mdash;Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
you, John!" he said, pointing excitedly
at what he suddenly saw; "there he goes,
with the recruiting serjeant!"</p>

<p>The father ran towards the soldier and his child;
and every group on the Coal-hill was speedily in
motion when they saw and heard the father endeavouring
to drag off the lad from the soldier, who
seized the arm of his prize, and endeavoured to detain
him. An increasing crowd soon hemmed in the
party,&mdash;a great tumult arose,&mdash;and three policemen
were speedily on the spot.</p>

<p>"Stick to your resolution, my boy!" cried the
soldier, grasping the lad's arm with all his might;
"you'll never want bread nor clothes in the army."</p>

<p>"But he'll be a sold slave, and must be shot at,
like a dog!" cried the father, striving to rescue his
child,&mdash;a pale, tall stripling, who seemed to be but
sixteen or seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>"Man-butcher!&mdash;Blood-hound!" shouted several
voices in the crowd: whereat the policemen raised
their staves, and called aloud to the crowd to "stand
back!"</p>

<p>"I demand, in the Queen's name, that you make
this fellow loose his hold of my recruit!" said the
soldier, in a loud, angry tone, to the policemen; two
of whom seemed to be about obeying him, when a
dark, stern-browed man among the crowd, of much
more strong and sinewy appearance than the majority
of the working multitude who composed it, stepped
forward, and said,&mdash;</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>"Let any policemen touch him that dare! If
they do they shall repent it! There's no law to prevent
a father from taking hold of his own child's arm
to hinder him from playing the fool!"</p>

<p>The men in blue slunk back at these words; and
the soldier himself seemed intimidated at perceiving
the father's cause taken up by an individual of such
determination.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the determined man to the lad,
"have you taken the soldier's money?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered the lad, after a few moments'
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Then he shall have my life before he has thee!"
said the father, whose heart leaped at the answer,
and infused so much strength into his arm, that with
another pull he brought off his lad, entirely, from
the soldier's hold. The crowd now burst into a
shout of triumph; and when the soldier would have
followed, to recapture his victim, the stern-browed
man confronted him with a look of silent defiance;
and the red-coat, after uttering a volley of oaths,
walked off amidst the derision of the multitude.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you were a fool, Tom, to be
juggled with that cut-throat?" said the stern-browed
man to the lad, while the crowd gathered around
him and his father.</p>

<p>"I wasn't so soon juggled," replied the lad; "he's
been at me this three months; but I never yielded
till this morning, when I felt almost pined to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and he made me have some breakfast with him,&mdash;but
he'll not get hold of me again!"</p>

<p>"That's right, my lad!" said one of the crowd;
"the bloody rascals have not had two Leicester recruits
these two years; and I hope they'll never have
another."</p>

<p>"No, no, our eyes are getting opened," said another
working-man; "they may be able to kill us
off by starvation, at home; but I hope young and
old will have too much sense, in future, to give or
sell their bodies to be shot at, for tyrants."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, we should soon set the lordlings fast,
if all working-men refused to go for soldiers," said
another.</p>

<p>"So we should, Smith," said a sedate-looking
elderly man; "that's more sensible than talking of
fighting when we've no weapons, nor money to buy
'em, nor strength to use 'em."</p>

<p>"Then we shall wait a long while for the Charter,
if we wait till we get it by leaving 'em no soldiers to
keep us down," said a young, bold-looking man, with
a fiery look; "for they'll always find plenty of
Johnny Raws ready to list in the farming districts."</p>

<p>"And we shall wait a longer while still if we try
to get it by fighting, under our present circumstances,"
answered the elderly man, in a firm tone;
"that could only make things worse, as all such
fool's tricks have ended, before."</p>

<p>"You're right, Randal, you're right!" cried several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
voices in the crowd; and the advocate of the bugbear
"physical force" said not another word on the
subject.</p>

<p>"No, no, lads!" continued the "moral force" man,
"let us go on, telling 'em our minds, without whispering,&mdash;and
let us throw off their cursed priestcraft,&mdash;and
the system will come to an end,&mdash;and
before long. But fighting tricks would be sure to
fail; because they're the strongest,&mdash;and they know
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must end,&mdash;and very soon," observed
another working-man; "the shopkeepers won't be
long before they join us; for they begin to squeak,
most woefully."</p>

<p>"The shopkeepers, lad!" said the dark-looking
man, who had confronted the soldier; "never let us
look for their help: there is not a spark of independence
in any of 'em: they have had it in their
power, by their votes, to have ended misrule, before
now, if they had had the will."</p>

<p>"Poor devils! they're all fast at their bankers',
and dare no more vote against their tyrants than
they dare attempt to fly," said another.</p>

<p>"There is no dependence on any of the middle
class," said the dark-looking man; "they are as bad
as the aristocrats. You see this last winter has
passed over, entirely, without any subscription for
the poor, again,&mdash;as severe a winter as it has
been."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, and work scarcer and scarcer, every day,"
said another.</p>

<p>"They say there are eight hundred out o'work
now, in Leicester," said the elderly, sedate man, who
had spoken before; "and I heard a manufacturer say
there would be twice as many before the summer
went over: but he added, that the people deserved
to be pinched, since they would not join the Corn
Law Repealers."</p>

<p>A burst of indignation, and some curses and imprecations,
followed.</p>

<p>"Does he go to chapel?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Yes; and he's a member of the Charles Street
meeting," said the elderly man.</p>

<p>"There's your religion, again!"&mdash;"There's
your saintship!"&mdash;"There's your Christianity!"&mdash;"There's
their Providence and their Goddle
Mitey!"&mdash;were the varied indignant exclamations
among the starved crowd, as soon as the answer was
heard.</p>

<p>"I should think they invented the Bastile Mill,
while they were at chapel!" said one.</p>

<p>"Is it smashed again?" asked another.</p>

<p>"No; but it soon will be," answered the man who
confronted the soldier.</p>

<p>These, and similar observations, were uttered
aloud, in the open street, at broad day, by hundreds
of starved, oppressed, and insulted framework-knitters,
who thus gave vent to their despair. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
conversations were customary sounds in John's ears,
and, having recovered his son, he took him by the
arm, after this brief delay, and, walking slowly back
towards the Roman milestone, the two bent their
steps down the narrow street called Barkby Lane.</p>

<p>After threading an alley, they reached a small
wretchedly furnished habitation; and the lad burst
into tears, as his mother sprung from her laborious
employ at the wash-tub, and threw her arms round
his neck, and kissed him. Two or three neighbours
came in, in another minute, and congratulating the
father and mother, on their having found their son,
a conversation followed on the hatefulness of becoming
"a paid cut-throat for tyrants," the substance of
which would have been as unpleasing to "the powers
that be" as the conversation in the street, had they
heard the two. The entry, into the squalid-looking
house, of another neighbour, pale and dejected beyond
description, gave a new turn to the homely
discourse.</p>

<p>"Your son has come back, I see, John," said the
new-comer, in a very faint voice: "I wish my
husband would come home."</p>

<p>"Thy husband, Mary!" said John; "why, where's
he gone? Bless me, woman, how ill you look!&mdash;What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>The woman's infant had begun to cry while she
spoke; and she had bared her breast, and given it to
the child: but&mdash;Nature was exhausted! there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
milk;&mdash;and, while the infant struggled and screamed,
the woman fainted.</p>

<p>She recovered, under the kindly and sympathetic
attention of the neighbours; and the scanty resources
of the group were laid under contribution for restoring
some degree of strength, by means of food, to the
woman and her child. One furnished a cup of milk,
another a few spoonfuls of oatmeal, another brought
a little bread; and when the child was quieted, and
the mother was able, she commenced her sad narrative.
She had not, she said, tasted food of any
kind for a day and two nights: she had pawned or
sold every article of clothing, except what she had
on, and she was without a bonnet entirely: nor had
her husband any other clothes than the rags in which
he had gone out, two hours before, with the intent
to try the relieving officer, once more, for a loaf, or
a trifle of money: to complete their misery, they
owed six weeks' rent for the room in which lay the
bag of shavings that formed their bed; and, if they
could not pay the next week's rent, they must turn
out into the street, or go into the Bastile.</p>

<p>Her recital was scarcely concluded, when the sorrowful
husband returned. He had been driven away
by the relieving officer, and threatened with the gaol,
if he came again, unless it was to bring his wife and
child with him to enter the Union Bastile!&mdash;and
the man sat down, and wept.</p>

<p>And then the children of misery mingled their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
consolations,&mdash;if reflections drawn from despair could
be so called,&mdash;and endeavoured to fortify the heart of
the yielding man, by reminding him that they would
not have to starve long, for life, with all its miseries,
would soon be over.</p>

<p>"I wonder why it ever begun!" exclaimed the
man who had been yielding to tears, but now suddenly
burst out into bitter language: "I think it's
a pity but that God had found something better to
do than to make such poor miserable wretches as
we are!"</p>

<p>"Lord! what queer thoughts thou hast, Jim!"
said the woman who had previously fainted, and she
burst into a half-convulsive laugh.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it's altogether a mystery to me," said
the man who had so recently found his son; "we
seem to be born for nothing but trouble. And
then the queerest thing is that we are to go to hell,
at last, if we don't do every thing exactly square.
My poor father always taught me to reverence religion;
and I don't like to say any thing against it,
but I'm hard put to it, at times, Jim, I'll assure ye.
It sounds strange, that we are to be burnt for ever,
after pining and starving here; for how can a man
keep his temper, and be thankful, as they say we
ought to be, when he would work and can't get it,
and, while he starves, sees oppressors ride in their
gigs, and build their great warehouses?"</p>

<p>"It's mere humbug, John, to keep us down:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
that's what it is!" said Jim: "one of these piety-mongers
left us a tract last week; and what should
it contain but that old tale of Bishop Burnet, about
the widow that somebody who peeped through the
chinks of the window-shutters saw kneeling by a
table with a crust of bread before her, and crying
out in rapture, 'All this and Christ!' I tell thee
what, John, if old Burnet had been brought down
from his gold and fat living, and had tried it himself,
I could better have believed him. It's a tale told like
many others to make fools and slaves of us: that's
what I think. Ay, and I told the long-faced fellow
so that fetched the tract. He looked very sourly at
me, and said the poor did not use to trouble themselves
about politics in his father's time, and every
body was more comfortable then than they are now.
'The more fools were they,' said I: 'if the poor had
begun to think of their rights sooner, instead of
listening to religious cant, we should not have been
so badly off now:' and away he went, and never
said another word.</p>

<p>"But I don't like to give way to bad thoughts
about religion, after all, Jim," said John: "it's
very mysterious&mdash;the present state of things: but
we may find it all explained in the next life."</p>

<p>"Prythee, John," exclaimed the other, interrupting
him, impatiently, "don't talk so weakly. That's
the way they all wrap it up; and if a guess in the
dark and a 'maybe' will do for an argument, why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
any thing will do. Until somebody can prove to me
that there <i>is</i> another life after this, I shall think it
my duty to think about this only. Now just look
at this, John! If there be another life after this,
why the present is worth nothing: every moment
here ought to be spent in caring for eternity; and
every man who really believes in such a life would
not care how he passed this, so that he could but be
making a preparation for the next: isn't that true,
John?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it is, Jim; and what o' that?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, tell me which of 'em believes in
such a life. Do you see any of the canting tribe less
eager than others to get better houses, finer chairs
and tables, larger shops, and more trade? Is old
Sour-Godliness in the north, there, more easily
brought to give up a penny in the dozen to save a
starving stockinger than the grinders that don't profess
religion? I tell thee, John, it's all fudge: they
don't believe it themselves, or else they would imitate
Christ before they tell us to be like him!"</p>

<p>Reader! the conversation shall not be prolonged,
lest the object of this sketch should be mistaken.
These conversations are <i>real</i>: they are no coinages.
Go to Leicester, or any other of the suffering towns
of depressed manufacture, where men compete with
each other in machinery till human hands are of
little use, and rival each other in wicked zeal to
reduce man to the merest minimum of subsistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
If the missionary people&mdash;and this is not said with
a view to question the true greatness and utility of
their efforts&mdash;if they would be consistent, let them
send their heralds into the manufacturing districts,
and first convert the "infidels" there, ere they send
their expensive messengers to India. But let it be
understood that the heralds must be furnished with
brains, as well as tongues; for whoever enters
Leicester, or any other of the populous starving
hives of England, must expect to find the deepest
subjects of theology, and government, and political
economy, taken up with a subtlety that would often
puzzle a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. Whoever
supposes the starving "manufacturing masses"
know no more, and can use no better language, than
the peasantry in the agricultural counties, will find
himself egregiously mistaken. 'Tis ten to one but
he will learn more of a profound subject in one hour's
conversation of starving stockingers than he would
do in ten lectures of a university professor. Let the
missionary people try these quarters, then; but let
their heralds "know their business" ere they go, or
they will make as slow progress as Egede and the
Moravians among the Greenlanders. One hint may
be given. Let them begin with the manufacturers;
and, if they succeed in making <i>real</i> converts to
Christianity in that quarter, their success will be
tolerably certain among the working-men, and tolerably
easy in its achievement.</p>

<p>There is no "tale" to finish about John or his
lad, or Jem and his wife. They went on starving,&mdash;begging,&mdash;receiving
threats of imprisonment,&mdash;tried
the "Bastile" for a few weeks,&mdash;came out and had
a little work,&mdash;starved again; and they are still
going the same miserable round, like thousands in
"merrie England." What are your thoughts,

<div class="chapter">
<h2>SETH THOMPSON, THE STOCKINGER;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
"WHEN THINGS ARE AT THE WORST,<br />
THEY BEGIN TO MEND."</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Leicestershire stockingers call that a false proverb.
"People have said so all our lives," say they; "but,
although we have each and all agreed, every day,
that things were at the worst, they never begun to
mend yet!" This was not their language sixty years
ago, but it is their daily language <i>now</i>; and the
story that follows is but, as it were, of yesterday.</p>

<p>Seth Thompson was the only child of a widow,
by the time that he was six years old, and became a
"winding boy," in a shop of half-starved framework-knitters
at Hinckley,&mdash;a kindred lot with hundreds
of children of the same age, in Leicestershire. Seth's
mother was a tender mother to her child; but he
met tenderness in no other quarter. He was weakly,
and since that rendered him unable to get on with his
winding of the yarn as fast as stronger children, he
was abused and beaten by the journeymen, while the
master stockinger, for every slight flaw in his work,&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
it always resulted from a failure of strength
rather than carelessness,&mdash;unfeelingly took the opportunity
to "dock" his paltry wages.</p>

<p>Since her child could seldom add more than a
shilling or fifteen-pence to the three, or, at most, four
shillings, she was able to earn herself,&mdash;and she had
to pay a heavy weekly rent for their humble home,&mdash;it
will readily be understood that neither widow
Thompson nor Seth were acquainted with the
meaning of the word "luxury," either in food or
habits. A scanty allowance of oatmeal and water
formed their breakfast, potatoes and salt their dinner,
and a limited portion of bread, with a wretchedly
diluted something called "tea" as an accompaniment,
constituted their late afternoon, or evening meal; and
they knew no variety for years, winter or summer.
The widow's child went shoeless in the warm season,
and the cast-off substitutes he wore in winter, together
with lack of warmth in his poor mother's
home, and repulses from the shop fire by the master
and men while at work, subjected him, through
nearly the whole of every winter, to chilblains and
other diseases of the feet. Rags were his familiar
acquaintances, and, boy-like, he felt none of the
aching shame and sorrow experienced by his mother
when she beheld his destitute covering, and reflected
that her regrets would not enable her to amend his
tattered condition.</p>

<p>Seth's mother died when he reached fifteen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
expressed thankfulness, on her death-bed, that she
was about to quit a world of misery, after being permitted
to live till her child was in some measure able
to struggle for himself. In spite of hard usage and
starvation, Seth grew up a strong lad, compared with
the puny youngsters that form the majority of the
junior population in manufacturing districts. He
was quick-witted, too, and had gathered a knowledge
of letters and syllables, amidst the references
to cheap newspapers and hourly conversation on
politics by starving and naturally discontented stockingers.
From a winding-boy, Seth was advanced to
the frame, and, by the time he had reached seventeen,
was not only able to earn as much as any other
stockinger in Hinckley, when he could get work,
but, with the usually improvident haste of the miserable
and degraded, married a poor "seamer," who
was two years younger than himself.</p>

<p>Seth Thompson at twenty-one, with a wife who
was but nineteen, had become the parent of four
children; and since he had never been able to bring
home to his family more than seven shillings in one
week, when the usual villainous deductions were
made by master and manufacturer, in the shape of
"frame-rent" and other "charges,"&mdash;since he had
often had but <i>half</i>-work, with the usual deduction of
<i>whole</i> charges, and had been utterly without work for
six several periods, of from five to nine weeks each,
during the four years of his married life,&mdash;the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
hasty sketch of the picture which this "home
of an Englishman" presented one noon, when a
stranger knocked at the door, and it was opened by
Seth himself, will scarcely be thought overdrawn:&mdash;</p>

<p>Except a grey deal table, there was not a single
article within the walls which could be called "furniture,"
by the least propriety of language. This
stood at the farther side of the room, and held a few
soiled books and papers, Seth's torn and embrowned
hat, and the mother's tattered straw bonnet. The
mother sat on a three-legged stool, beside an osier
cradle, and was suckling her youngest child while
she was eating potatoes and salt from an earthen
dish upon her knee. Seth's dish of the same food
stood on a seat formed of a board nailed roughly
across the frame of a broken chair; while, in the
centre of the floor, where the broken bricks had disappeared
and left the earth bare, the three elder
babes sat squatted round a board whereon boiled
potatoes in their skins were piled,&mdash;a meal they were
devouring greedily, squeezing the inside of the root
into their mouths with their tiny hands, after the
mode said to be practised in an Irish cabin. An
empty iron pot stood near the low expiring fire, and
three rude logs of wood lay near it,&mdash;the children's
usual seats when they had partaken their meal. A
description of the children's filthy and bedaubed appearance
with the potatoe starch, and of the "looped
and windowed" rags that formed their covering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
could only produce pain to the reader. Seth's clothing
was not much superior to that of his offspring; but
the clean cap and coloured cotton handkerchief of the
mother, with her own really beautiful but delicate
face and form, gave some relief to the melancholy
picture.</p>

<p>Seth blushed, as he took up his dish of potatoes,
and offered the stranger his fragment of a seat. And
the stranger blushed, too, but refused the seat with a
look of so much benevolence that Seth's heart glowed
to behold it; and his wife set down her porringer,
and hushed the children that the stranger might deliver
his errand with the greater ease.</p>

<p>"Your name is Thompson, I understand," said
the stranger; "pray, do you know what was your
mother's maiden name?"</p>

<p>"Greenwood,&mdash;Martha Greenwood was my poor
mother's maiden name, sir," replied Seth, with the
tears starting to his eyes.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to have some difficulty in
restraining similar feelings; and gazed, sadly, round
upon the room and its squalid appearance, for a few
moments, in silence.</p>

<p>Seth looked hard at his visitor, and thought of
one whom his mother had often talked of; but did
not like to put an abrupt question, though he imagined
the stranger's features strongly resembled his
parent's.</p>

<p>"Are working people in Leicestershire usually so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
uncomfortably situated as you appear to be?" asked
the stranger, in a tone of deep commiseration which
he appeared to be unable to control.</p>

<p>Seth Thompson and his wife looked uneasily at
each other, and then fixed their gaze on the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," replied Seth, blushing more deeply
than before, "we married very betime, and our family,
you see, has grown very fast; we hope things will
mend a little with us when some o' the children are
old enough to earn a little. We've only been badly
off as yet, but you'd find a many not much better
off, sir, I assure you, in Hinckley and elsewhere."</p>

<p>The stranger paused again, and the working of his
features manifested strong inward feeling.</p>

<p>"I see nothing but potatoes," he resumed; "I
hope your meal is unusually poor to-day, and that you
and your family generally have a little meat at
dinner."</p>

<p>"Meat, sir!" exclaimed Seth; "we have not
known what it is to set a bit of meat before our
children more than three times since the first was
born; we usually had a little for our Sunday dinner
when we were first married, but we can't afford it
now!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried the stranger, with a look
that demonstrated his agony of grief and indignation,
"is this England,&mdash;the happy England, that
I have heard the blacks in the West Indies talk of
as a Paradise?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you my mother's brother? Is your name
Elijah Greenwood?" asked Seth Thompson, unable
longer to restrain the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the visitor, and sat down upon
Seth's rude seat, to recover his self-possession.&mdash;</p>

<p>That was a happy visit for poor Seth Thompson,
and his wife and children. His mother had often
talked of her only brother who went for a sailor when
a boy, and was reported to be settled in some respectable
situation in the West Indies, but concerning
whom she never received any certain information.
Elijah Greenwood had suddenly become rich, by the
death of a childless old planter, whom he had faithfully
served, and who had left him his entire estate.
England was Elijah's first thought, when this circumstance
took place; and, as soon as he could settle
his new possession under some careful and trusty
superintendence till his return, he had taken ship,
and come to his native country and shire. By
inquiry at the inn, he had learnt the afflictive fact of
his sister's death, but had been guided to the poverty-stricken
habitation of her son.</p>

<p>That was the last night that Seth Thompson and
his children slept on their hard straw sacks on the
floor,&mdash;the last day that they wore rags and tatters,
and dined upon potatoes and salt. Seth's uncle
placed him in a comfortable cottage, bought him
suitable furniture, gave him a purse of 50<i>l.</i> for ready
money, and promised him a half-yearly remittance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
from Jamaica, for the remainder of his, the uncle's,
life, with a certainty of a considerable sum at his
death.</p>

<p>Seth and his wife could not listen, for a moment,
to a proposal for leaving England, although they had
experienced little but misery in it, their whole lives.
The uncle, however, obtained from them a promise
that they would not restrain any of their children
from going out to Jamaica; and did not leave them
till he had seen them fairly and comfortably settled,
and beheld what he thought a prospect of comfort for
them, in the future. Indeed, on the very morning
succeeding that in which Seth's new fortune became
known, the hitherto despised stockinger was sent for
by the principal manufacturer of hosen, in Hinckley,
and offered "a shop of frames," in the language of
the working men; that is, he was invited to become
a "master," or one who receives the "stuff" from
the capitalist or manufacturer, and holds of him,
likewise, a given number of frames,&mdash;varying from
half-a-dozen to a score or thirty, or even more; and
thus becomes a profit-sharing middleman between the
manufacturer and the labouring framework-knitters.
Seth accepted the offer, for it seemed most natural
to him to continue in the line of manufacture to
which he had been brought up; and his uncle, with
pleasurable hopes for his prosperity, bade him farewell!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Seth to his wife, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
sat down to a plentiful dinner, surrounded with their
neatly-dressed and happy children, the day after the
uncle's departure, "we used to say we should never
prove the truth of the old proverb, but we have
proved it at last: times came to the worst with us,
and began to mend."</p>

<p>"Thank God! we have proved it, my love," replied
the wife; "and I wish our poor neighbours could
prove it as well."</p>

<p>Seth sighed,&mdash;and was silent.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Some years rolled over, and Seth Thompson had
become a well-informed, and deep-thinking man, but
one in whom was no longer to be found that passionate
attachment to his native country which he once felt.
The manufacturer under whom he exercised the office
of "master," had borrowed the greater part of Seth's
uncle's remittances, as regularly as they arrived; and
as Seth received due interest for these loans, and
confided that the manufacturer's wealth was real,
he believed he was taking a prudent way of laying
up enough for the maintenance of his old age, or for
meeting the misfortunes of sickness, should they come.
But the manufacturer broke; and away went all that
Seth had placed in his hands. Every week failures
became more frequent,&mdash;employ grew scantier, for
trade was said to decrease, though machinery increased,&mdash;discontent
lowered on every brow,&mdash;and
the following sketch of what was said at a meeting
of starving framework-knitters held in Seth Thompson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
shop but a month before he quitted England
for ever, may serve to show what were his own reflections,
and those of the suffering beings around
him.</p>

<p>About twenty working men had assembled, and
stood in three or four groups,&mdash;no "chairman"
having been, as yet, chosen, since a greater number
of attendants was expected.</p>

<p>"I wish thou would throw that ugly thing away,
Timothy!" said a pale, intellectual looking workman,
to one whose appearance was rendered filthy,
in addition to his ragged destitution, by a dirty pipe
stuck in his teeth, and so short that the head scarcely
projected beyond his nose.</p>

<p>"I know it's ugly, Robert," replied the other, in a
tone between self-accusation and despair,&mdash;"but it
helps to pass away time. I've thrown it away twice,&mdash;but
I couldn't help taking to it again last week,
when I had nought to do. I think I should have
hanged myself if I had not smoked a bit o' 'bacco."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm resolute that I'll neither smoke nor
drink any more," said a third: "the tyrants can do
what they like with us, as long as we feed their vices
by paying taxes. If all men would be o' my mind
there would soon be an end of their extravagance,&mdash;for
they would have nothing to support it."</p>

<p>"Indeed, James," replied the smoker, "I don't
feel so sure about your plan as you seem to be, yourself:
you'll never persuade all working-men to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
up a sup of ale or a pipe, if they can get hold of
either; but, not to talk of that, what's to hinder the
great rascals from inventing other taxes if these
fail?"</p>

<p>"They couldn't easily be hindered, unless we had
all votes," said the first speaker, "we're all well aware
of that; but it would put 'em about, and render the
party more unpopular that wanted to put on a new
tax."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's so certain, either," replied
the smoker; "depend on't, neither Whigs nor Tories
will run back from the support of taxes. D'ye ever
read of either party agreeing to 'stop the supplies,' as
they call it, or join in any measure to prevent taxes
from being collected till grievances are redressed?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, not we," chimed another, lighting
his short pipe by the help of his neighbour's, and
folding his arms, with a look of something like mock
bravery; "and, for my part, I don't think they ever
will be redressed till we redress 'em ourselves!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Joseph!" said the pale-looking man, shaking
his head, "depend upon it that's all a dream! How
are poor starvelings like us, who have neither the
means of buying a musket, nor strength to march and
use it, if he had it,&mdash;how are we to overthrow thousands
of disciplined troops with all their endless resources
of ammunition?&mdash;It's all a dream, Joseph!
depend on't."</p>

<p>"Then what are we to do,&mdash;lie down and die?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
asked the other; but looked as if he were aware he
had spoken foolishly, under the impulse of despair.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I often wish to die," said another,
joining the conversation in a doleful tone; "I've
buried my two youngest, and the oldest lad's going
fast after his poor mother; one can't get bread enough
to keep body and soul together!"</p>

<p>"Well, if it hadn't been for Seth Thompson's
kindness," said another, "I believe I should have
been dead by this time. I never felt so near putting
an end to my life as I did last Sunday morning.
I've been out o' work, now, nine weeks; and last
Saturday I never put a crumb in my mouth, for I
couldn't get it, and I caught up a raw potatoe in
the street last Sunday morning, and ate it for sheer
hunger. Seth Thompson saw me, and&mdash;God bless
his heart!&mdash;he called me in and gave me a cup of
warm coffee and some toast, and slipped a shilling
into my hand." And the man turned aside to dash
away his tears.</p>

<p>"Ay, depend upon it, we shall miss Seth, when
he leaves us," said several voices together.</p>

<p>"It's many a year since there was a master in
Hinckley like him," said the man with the short
black pipe, "and, I fear, when he is gone, the whole
grinding crew will be more barefaced than ever with
their extortions and oppressions of poor men. Seth
knew what it was to be nipped himself when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
younger; that's the reason that he can feel for others
that suffer."</p>

<p>"It isn't always the case, though," said another;
"look at skin-flint Jimps, the glove-master; I remember
him when he was as ragged as an ass's colt:
and where is there such another grinding villain as
Jimps, now he is so well off?"</p>

<p>"The more's the shame for a man that preaches
and professes to be religious," said the smoker.</p>

<p>"It was but last Saturday forenoon," resumed the
man who had mentioned Jimps, the glove-master,
"that he docked us two-pence a dozen, again: and
when I asked him if his conscience wouldn't reproach
him when he went to chapel, he looked like a fiend,
and said, 'Bob! I knew what it was to be ground
once; but it's my turn to grind now!'"</p>

<p>"And they call that religion, do they?" said the
smoker, with an imprecation.</p>

<p>"It won't mend it to swear, my lad," said the intellectual-looking
man; "we know one thing,&mdash;that
whatever such a fellow as this may do that professes
religion, he doesn't imitate the conduct of his Master."</p>

<p>"I believe religion's all a bag of moonshine," said
the smoker, "or else they that profess it would not
act as they do."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so rashly, Tim," rejoined the other;
"we always repent when we speak in ill-temper.
Religion can't cure hypocrites, man, though it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
turn drunkards and thieves into sober and honest
men: it does not prove that religion is all a bag of
moonshine, because some scoundrels make a handle
of it. Truth's truth, in spite of all the scandal that
falsehood and deceit brings upon it."</p>

<p>"Isn't it time we got to business?" said one of
the group.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be of any use to wait longer,"
said another; "there will not be more with us, if we
wait another hour; the truth is, that men dare not
attend a meeting like this, for fear of being turned
off, and so being starved outright;&mdash;there's scarcely
any spirit left in Hinckley."</p>

<p>"I propose that Seth Thompson takes the chair,"
said another, taking off his ragged hat, and speaking
aloud.</p>

<p>A faint clapping of hands followed, and Seth took
a seat upon a raised part of one of the frames at the
end of the shop, and opened the meeting according to
the simple but business-like form, which working-men
are wont to observe in similar meetings, in the
manufacturing districts.</p>

<p>"I feel it would scarcely become me to say much,
my friends," he said, "since I am about to leave
you. I thought, at one time, that nothing could
have ever inclined me to leave old England; but it
seems like folly to me, now, to harbour an attachment
to a country where one sees nothing but
misery, nor any chance of improvement. I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
wish to damp your spirits; but if I were to tell you
how much uneasiness I have endured for some years
past, even while you have seen me apparently well
off and comfortable, you would not wonder that I
am resolved to quit this country, since I have the
offer of ease and plenty, though in a foreign clime.
I tell you, working men, that I had power over Mr.&mdash;&mdash;,
by the moneys I had lent him, or I should
have been turned out of this shop years ago. Week
by week have we quarrelled, because I would not
practise the tyrannies and extortions upon working
men that he recommended and urged. It is but a
hateful employ to a man of any feeling,&mdash;is that of
a master-stockinger under an avaricious and inhuman
hosier. But, if the master's situation be so far from
being a happy one, I need not tell you that I know well,
by experience, how much more miserable is that of the
starved and degraded working-man. Indeed, indeed,&mdash;I
see no hope for you, my friends,&mdash;yet, I repeat,
I would not wish to damp your spirits. Perhaps
things may mend yet; but I confess I see no likelihood
of it, till the poor are represented as well as the
rich."</p>

<p>It might produce weariness to go through all the
topics that were touched upon by Seth and others.
They were such as are familiarly handled, daily, in
the manufacturing districts; ay, and with a degree
of mental force and sound reasoning,&mdash;if not with
polish of words,&mdash;that would make some gentlefolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
stare, if they were to hear the sounds proceeding from
the haggard figures in rags who often utter them. The
"deceit" of the Reform Bill, as it is usually termed
by manufacturing "operatives;" the trickery of the
Whigs; the corruption and tyranny of the Tories;
the heartlessness of the manufacturers and "the
League;" and the right of every sane Englishman
of one and twenty years of age to a vote in the
election of those who have to govern him, were
each and all broadly, and unshrinkingly, and yet not
intemperately, asserted.</p>

<p>One or two, in an under-tone, ventured to suggest
that it might be advantageous to try, once more,
to act with the Anti-Corn Law men, since many
of the members of the League professed democracy;
and, if that were done, working men would not fear
to attend a meeting such as that they were then
holding. But this was scouted by the majority;
and a proposal was, at length, made, in a written
form, and seconded,&mdash;"That a branch of an association
of working men, similar to one that was stated
to have been just established at Leicester, should be
formed." The motion was put and carried,&mdash;a committee,
and secretary, and treasurer, were chosen,&mdash;and
the men seemed to put off their dejection, and
grow energetic in their resolution to attempt their
own deliverance from misery, in the only way that
they conceived it could ever be substantially effected:
but their purpose came to the ears of the manufacturers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
on the following day, threats of loss of
work were issued, and no association was established!</p>

<p>Seth Thompson took his family to the West
Indies, pursuant to the many and urgent requests contained
in his uncle's letters, and soon entered upon the
enjoyment of the plenty in store for him. Hinckley
stockingers remain in their misery still; and, perhaps,
there is scarcely a place in England where
starving working men have so little hope,&mdash;although
"things," they say, "have come to the worst,"&mdash;that
"they" will ever "begin to mend."</p>

<h2>SAM SIMKINS, THE RUN-AWAY;<br />
<span class="small">OR,<br />
VILLAINY AS A REFUGE FROM THE TORTURES OF<br />
SOUR-GODLINESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Sam Simkins was a wild lad,&mdash;but whose fault
was it that he became so? That was the significant
question which uniformly followed the commemoration
of his history among the old women of the
village where he was born, and where, after the
early death of his father and mother, he was apprenticed,
by the parish, to Mr. Jonas Straitlace, the
saddler and collar-maker. The village was not more
than half-a-dozen miles from Birmingham; and to
that town Sam usually trudged once or twice in the
working part of the week on his master's business
errands, and, invariably, accompanied his master
thither twice on the Sunday, to attend the ministry
of a Calvinistic teacher.</p>

<p>With the exception of a very restricted number of
hours for sleep, these were the only portions of Sam's
existence that could come within the name of relaxation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Some people gave Sam's master the title of
a "money-grub;" but Mr. Jonas Straitlace himself
modestly laid claim to the character of one who was
"diligent in business, fervent in spirit, and&mdash;&mdash;" the
reader knows the rest. In brief, he was one of
the too numerous description of folk who cast their
sour into the sweets of innocent enjoyment on every
occasion within their compass, and strive to throw a
universal pall over the world by keeping their fellow-creatures
in mind that the next life alone is worth a
moment's thought,&mdash;and yet, daily and hourly illustrate
their own gloomy lesson by grasping at the dirt
called money as eagerly as if they believed they could
carry it with them over the ford of the grave, and
that it would be still more current coin in the
next life than in this. Strict rates of charge to his
customers in an age of competition prevented Straitlace
from extending his business; but the consequence
was, that he grew more pinching towards
himself, and still more towards his apprentice, in
allowing the body its proper amount of sustenance,
or the general constitution its necessary share of
healthful unbending. Sam was pinched in his
measure of food, and watched while he ate it, lest
the spoon should travel so slowly to his mouth as to
prevent his return to labour after the lapse of an appointed
number of minutes; he was "alarumed" up
at five in winter, and at four in summer, and kept at
the bench till eight; and what went down more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
hardly with Sam than either scant food and sleep, or
unceasingly painful toil, was the fact, that his
master's vinegared piety overflowed with such zeal for
Sam's spiritual welfare as to compel him to spend the
remaining time till ten, every working-day evening,
in reading one book. Nay, the lad, in spite of the
remembrance that every other apprentice in the village
was allowed, at least, an hour's holyday-time,
each day, would have felt it to be some amelioration
of his captive lot, had he been allowed to derive such
amusement from the book as it might afford; but
Straitlace's zeal for Sam's happiness in the next life,
taught him that he must use even this extreme
resort to mortify the lad in the present state of existence,
and, therefore, Sam must read nothing but
the Prophets, in one division of the book, and the
Epistles, in the other!</p>

<p>Such was the discipline to which Mr. Jonas
Straitlace subjected Sam Simkins from the age of
nine, when the parish placed the lad under his care,
to fifteen. Straitlace had one invariable answer to
all who remonstrated with him on the undue severity,
the imprisoning strictness, he exercised towards his
apprentice:&mdash;"Train up a child in the way he
should go," he would say, quoting the whole text,
"that's a Bible reason for what I do: it doesn't
allow me to parley with flesh and blood: I must
obey it."</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas Straitlace had found that fine moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
pearl in the great Oriental treasure-house of the
wisdom-jewels of ages, and he was too sordidly ignorant
to know that the originator of the maxim never
intended the "should go" to be left to the judicature
either of brain-sick zealots and morbid pietists, or of
rash experimenters and fanciful speculatists. But
what cared Straitlace about the legitimate and fair interpretation
of the text? His ready quotation of it
served his purpose: it kept "meddlers," as he called
them, at arm's length, and secured the links of that
grinding slavery which held Sam to his task, and
brought money into the till.</p>

<p>It would be a heart-sickening detail, that of the
incidental miseries Sam experienced in these six
years: suffice it to say, his chain was tightened till
it snapped. He contrived to form an acquaintance
in Birmingham who advised him to "cut" his tyrant-master,
and "cut" him he did. Yet, Mr. Jonas
Straitlace knew the value of Sam's earnings too well
to be inclined to give up his bird without trying to
catch it again. He set out for Birmingham, made
inquiry, and learned that Sam, in spite of being minuted
by his master's watch, had contrived, almost
uniformly, on his errands, to spend a quarter of an hour
in a certain low public-house, and that he had done
this, habitually, for more than a twelvemonth past.
Straitlace bent his steps to this resort, and, by his
crafty mode of questioning, ascertained from the
landlord that Sam had that very morning been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
his house with one "Jinks,"&mdash;yet that was not the
man's right name, the landlord added, but only a
name he went by.</p>

<p>"And pray who is this Jinks?" asked Straitlace.</p>

<p>"He was once a man in great trust, sir," answered
the landlord, with some solemnity: "he was head
clerk in a first-rate lawyers's office in this town.
But it was found out at last, that Jinks had 'bezzled
a good deal o' money belonging to the firm; and so
he was sent to gaol for a couple o' year; nay, he
was very near being hanged. And so when he came
out o' limbo, you understand, why nobody would
trust, or hardly look on him; and he's now got from
bad to worse."</p>

<p>"What mean you by that?" asked Jonas.</p>

<p>"The least said is the soonest mended," replied the
landlord.</p>

<p>"I wish you could tell me where I could see
this man," said Straitlace: "the lad is my apprentice,
and this man will do him no good: besides, I
am losing money by his absence."</p>

<p>The landlord stared, bit his lip, with a look that
told he wished he had not talked so fast, and then
made answer that he was busy that morning, and, besides,
it was ten thousand to one whether Jinks
could be found in his hiding-hole, if they were to go
to it:&mdash;"and, more than all," he added, "there
is no believing him, he is such a fellow to thump:
he tells so many lies, poking his eyes into every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
corner, and never looking in your face all the while,
that I often think Jinks must find it hard to invent
new ones."</p>

<p>Straitlace was versed sufficiently in human character
to discern that the prattling landlord was made
of squeezable materials, and so he urged his questions
and entreaties until he had won his point, and the
landlord undertook to conduct him to "Jinks's hiding
hole."</p>

<p>Threading an alley in one of the dingiest streets in
the town, they wound through several crooked passages,
and arrived at a paltry-looking small square.
From a corner of this dirty and half-ruined quadrangle,
the landlord advanced along a path that could
scarcely be supposed to lead to a human dwelling.
It was what is designated a "twitchel" in the midland
counties, being barely wide enough to admit one
person at a time,&mdash;and was the boundary line of
two rows of buildings, the eaves of which overhung
it, and rendered the passage as gloomy as if it were
scarcely yet twilight. Straitlace scrambled with difficulty
after his conductor, and over the heaps of
cinders, broken pots, and oyster and muscle shells
which lay along this dark tract; and when they
came to the end of it, and had descended half-a-dozen
stone steps, they arrived at what looked like
the door of a cellar. Here the landlord shook his
fist at Straitlace, and compressed his features, as a
signal for his companion to keep strict silence. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
then tapped, very gently, at the door; but, though
he repeated his timid knock, no one answered.</p>

<p>"Jinks! Jinks! I say," he whispered through the
key-hole, after he had knocked the third time.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" said a sharp, angry voice.</p>

<p>"It's only me, Jinks:&mdash;I want to speak t' ye,"
answered the landlord.</p>

<p>"You lie, Jemmy Jolter:&mdash;there's more than you
only," retorted Jinks, with a snarl so sudden and
crabbed that it flung the other entirely off his
guard.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but&mdash;but," Jemmy stammered; "this
person wants to see you about that youth that was
with you this morning, Jinks, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whew! Jemmy Jolter, you've let it out again,"
replied the strange voice within: "get home, ye
long-tongued fool, get home! what fool is that beside
ye to employ such a sieve to carry water?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Jinks," said the weak landlord,
turning round in dudgeon: "a time may come when
you may want a good turn doing, you know."</p>

<p>"I'll let you in, by yourself, Jemmy, if you like,"
said the keeper of this questionable garrison, fearful
of losing the good offices of the landlord; "or I'll
admit that verjuice-faced fellow who stands beside
you, with the white apron round him."</p>

<p>The outer party here looked at each other with
some alarm, on finding they were each seen so plainly
by one who was to them invisible.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't think I shall advise a respectable man
and a stranger to come into such a den as yours,
alone,&mdash;do ye, Jinks?" said the other, in a voice of
displeasure.</p>

<p>"Then you may both keep out," retorted the concealed
speaker; "at any rate, you'll both be safe
there. Twist my withers, if ever I admit two clients
into chambers at once! No, no! it wouldn't do,
Jemmy! What I say here goes into only one pair
of ears besides my own."</p>

<p>"I'll venture alone, if he'll only admit me," said
Straitlace, his eagerness to learn something of Sam,
and, if possible, to recover the possession of him,
subduing the repugnance he felt against trusting
himself alone in such suspicious company.</p>

<p>The door was slightly opened in a moment; and
before the landlord could remonstrate, Straitlace
was admitted, and the bolts were again closed within.
Jinks seized his visitor by the hand, and rapidly
pulled him up a dark stair. Straitlace's mind misgave
him, as he reached the top of the ascent: it
conducted to a narrow apartment in which there was
no furniture but a broken chair, and a strong wooden
bench; while a bottle, and an earthen pot, with some
discoloured papers, covered the end of a barrel which
appeared to serve the wretched habitant of the room
for a table. There was no fire in the dirty grate,
and viewed through the murky light admitted by the
small window which was half-obscured with papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
patching the broken panes, the appearance of the
squalid chamber sent a shuddering feeling over
Straitlace's skin.</p>

<p>"Well, and so now you are admitted to my
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i>,&mdash;what's your will?" asked Jinks,
with a grin of derision, and seating himself on the
broken chair.</p>

<p>Straitlace was not a timid man; but the dark skin,
projecting teeth, and overhanging brows of the figure
before him, and, more than all, the diabolical fire of
his eyes, really affrighted him, and he remained
speechless.</p>

<p>"Don't stare at me in that way, you fool," said
the grim figure, savagely; "I'm not a wizard, though
I do deal with the devil sometimes. What d'ye
want to know about Sam Simkins?"</p>

<p>Straitlace was amazed at the effrontery of the
fellow, in turn: "I insist upon it, that you tell me
where he is, since you seem to know," he said, his
displeasure giving him a little spirit.</p>

<p>"Whew!" was the only answer made by the
grim figure, who turned the empty pot towards the
light, and then looked into it, and then looked at
Straitlace, who was 'born sooner than yesterday,'
as they say in the midlands; but who was not disposed
to show that he penetrated the meaning of the
spunger's masonic sort of hint.</p>

<p>"I insist upon knowing where you have concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
my apprentice," said Straitlace, trying to put on a
bold look.</p>

<p>"I've neither concealed him, nor shall I snitch,
and tell you where he is, if you ape the bully," replied
Jinks, with cold mockery.</p>

<p>"Then, as sure as you sit there, you villain,"
answered Straitlace, thinking he should lose the end
of his errand entirely, if he did not keep up the
appearance of determination, "I'll have you before
a magistrate, and imprison you till the boy is produced."</p>

<p>"I advise you to be cool," answered Jinks, with a
look of such peculiar devilry that it made Straitlace
feel chill with fear: "you wouldn't get me before a
magistrate if you were to try. And, besides, there's
more than one can light a match; and your cottage
will burn, you know,&mdash;ay, and your collars and old
saddle traps too."</p>

<p>Straitlace dared not threaten now; he found that
the fellow knew him; and he felt the peril of the
ground he stood on. He sank on the bench, and
gazed timidly and silently at the broken-down
lawyer's clerk, who evidently enjoyed his triumph.</p>

<p>"You're cooler, I see," resumed Jinks, and then
looked into the earthen pot again.</p>

<p>"I don't mind a trifle, by way of recompense,"
said Straitlace, torturing his tongue to frame the
words, "if you'll only assist me in recovering my
apprentice."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"Rayther sensible that," answered Jinks tauntingly;
but still looked into the empty pot.</p>

<p>Straitlace overcame his own master-passion for the
instant, and placed a half-crown beside the empty
drinking cup; but Jinks instantly pushed it off the
barrel, into the floor, in contempt. Straitlace felt
the blood rush to his neck and face, but once more
struggled with his own reluctance, took up the half-crown,
and laid down a half-sovereign in its stead.</p>

<p>"Sensible,&mdash;very!" observed Jinks, slowly;
and then suddenly starting up, said, "Now, <i>Mister</i>
Jonas Straitlace, what will you give to have this
stray dog of yours put quietly into your hands,
muzzled and collared, so that you may take him home
safely?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough?" said the other leeringly.</p>

<p>"Two whole sovereigns into my hands to-morrow
morning at seven,&mdash;here,&mdash;at the bottom of the
steps,&mdash;and you have him. Otherwise, there's your
road, Mister Jonas Straitlace," returned Jinks, and
pointed to the stairs.</p>

<p>The saddler saw he was in a most disadvantageous
position for making a choice, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"I've other clients, and have no time to fool away
upon you," rejoined Jinks: "speak the word! yes or
no," and moved towards the steps.</p>

<p>"Then I'll be here at that time," answered Straitlace,
with a mental reservation; and he had scarcely
uttered the words when three knocks were distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
given under his feet; but Jinks seized his hand,
hurried him down the steps, and thrust him out, and
bolted the door behind him, with a strength and speed
that caused him to turn round and stare at the closed
door with wonder, when he stood once more in the
twitchel.</p>

<p>The landlord seized his arm, and recalled him to
the remembrance of where he was. Straitlace evaded
the landlord's inquiries as to the result of his errand,
persuaded that he could best carry into effect the
scheme which had suggested itself to him, with other
aid than that of a person who appeared to have some
connection with Jinks. He marked the way to the
door, and paid particular observance to the passages,
and to the exact locality of the street, and thanking
the landlord for his trouble, took his way home,
somewhat to the surprise of the landlord himself,
who had expected he would return to the public-house.</p>

<p>On the night succeeding the morning in which
Straitlace had been admitted to that squalid chamber,
the narrow space itself was changed into a hold of
guilty riot and thievish conspiracy. The fumes of
tobacco which filled the room would have rendered
respiration impossible to any but the actual participators
in that scene of infamy; the fog of smoke being
so dense that the human beings there assembled
seemed to be kneaded into the thick vapour rather
than surrounded by it. The struggling flames of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
fire which had just been kindled, and was covered by
a huge iron vessel, nearly choked up the draught of
the narrow chimney, and threw an uncertain light
upon the figures which nearly filled the narrow room.
The singular being who was the habitual tenant of
the chamber sat in his broken chair close by the fire,
augmenting the gross sociality of his associates by
the vehemence with which he consumed tobacco in a
wooden pipe; but adding not a word to their busy conversation.
A strong coarse-looking woman, crouched
immediately before the fire, was alternately attempting
to clear a passage for its progress, and slicing
onions from her apron to put into the caldron. Her
short clay pipe, with the filthy black cup scarcely
protruding beyond her nose, showed her attachment
to the favourite excitement of her depraved companions.
Behind her stood the barrel, before described
as the only substitute for a table in Jinks's
room, and upon the end of it was placed a large
metal jug of spirits, which the various members of
the group lifted to their lips, by turns, as inclination
moved them.</p>

<p>The confused conversation was suspended in a moment
by three distinct and measured raps being given
at the door below; and Jinks jumped up, exclaiming,
"That's the young'un I told you of: I'll let him in."
And he darted down the steps, unbolted the door,
pulled in Sam Simkins, and, in the lapse of scarcely
three minutes, introduced him to the villainous company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
The fellows gazed at Sam, and one swore
that he only looked like a starved rat, and another
said he was more like a stunted badger; but all
agreed that he looked likely to be useful, for he had
a hawk's eye in his head. Sam felt somewhat
loutish at the unrestrained gaze of the thieves; but
Jinks placed him upon the bench next his own chair,
chucked him under the chin, and holding the metal
jug to his mouth, told him to drink. Sam did drink
a little, and thought the draught scorched his throat;
yet in a few minutes he felt a flow of spirits that
completely banished his bashfulness.</p>

<p>"And so you've cut the starve-gut rascal, eh,
young'un?" said an impudent-looking fellow who sat
on the farther end of the bench, and who was, at
once, the most frequent visitor to the jug, and the
most eager talker in the villainous conclave.</p>

<p>"What the devil was he to do else?" said Jinks,
seeming to wish to keep off from the lad the assailment
of questions by the gang: "was he to stay and
be pined outright?&mdash;Bess," he continued, addressing
the woman, "isn't the stuff ready?"</p>

<p>"The can's empty," said the fellow who had just
spoken, interrupting Jinks: "we'll have it filled
again."</p>

<p>"Not to-night," said Jinks, with an oath.</p>

<p>"Not to-night!&mdash;why not, old hang-dog, and be
d&mdash;d to ye?" asked the other, dropping his pipe, and
looking as if he would fell his opposer.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"Because there's a job on hand that requires cool
brains, ye guzzling ape!" answered Jinks, in a tone
which showed he was not to be frightened by the
bully, his brother in roguery. "Wide-mouthed Bob
will be here directly, and we must then prepare for
business."</p>

<p>"What the devil can he be about to be so late?"
cried the woman, who was still squatted before the
fire: "the broth's ready, and I shall pour it out if
he doesn't come in a crack. Hark!" she said,&mdash;and
the quarrelsome crew were silent:&mdash;"there he is!"</p>

<p>Jinks started from his broken chair at the sound
of a whistle, hurried down the steps, and was speedily
in his old position again, while the new comer was
welcomed with shouts of "Give us your hand, captain!&mdash;success
to ye!"</p>

<p>"Silence, you fools!" said he who was thus
saluted: "d'ye mean to bring the bull-dogs upon
us?" And he took up the jug, but finding it empty,
he looked discontented. Jinks, however, seized the
jug, removed the barrel from the spot on which it
stood, pulled up a trap-door, and descended, and then
returned with the jug refilled, with the usual rapidity
that characterised his movements.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, you know who's come now, old juggler,"
said the bully, tauntingly, to Jinks as he again appeared
from the subterraneous room, with the vessel
full of brandy.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I know that they have a right to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
sugar-candy that are the first to put their fingers into
the fire to get it," said Jinks, showing his ugly teeth
very forbiddingly; "and not every skinking coward
that ties his neck to his heels to save it when there's
work to be done."</p>

<p>The bully returned no answer, seeming conscious
that his cowardice deserved the rebuke.</p>

<p>"Get the supper-tools out, Jinks," said the woman,
and took the boiling caldron from the fire.</p>

<p>Jinks climbed upon his chair, and reaching down
a large wooden bowl, from its concealment in the
ceiling of the room, placed it upon the end of the
barrel, and sat down again.</p>

<p>"Why, you old brute, do ye think we are going to
pig it all out of one trough, on a night like this?"
exclaimed the woman, pouring out the stew into the
bowl:&mdash;"reach every man his pap-spoon and dish,
or I'll spoil your grinding before you begin!" and she
aimed a blow, with a brazen ladle, at Jinks's scalp,
which he evaded, and reached forth a set of basins
and spoons from the same strange repository.</p>

<p>The steamy flavour of Bess's cookery speedily
attracted the appetites of her companions. Limbs of
fowls and game, mingled with the soup, showed the
illicit source from which such a company had obtained
the raw provisions for the meal. Bess poured
out half a basin of the stew first, for the individual
who was called "captain," and filling up the vessel
with brandy from the jug, handed it to the leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
with a coarse coaxing smile. She then served the
rest, in the order they sat, beginning with Jinks, and
not forgetting the lad. Sam smacked his lips at
such a treat, and congratulated himself on having
taken the advice of Jinks, and run away from his
master. He soon disposed of the contents of his
basin; and then felt strongly attracted to notice the
appearance and behaviour of him whom the thieves
acknowledged as their principal.</p>

<p>The personal appearance of Wide-mouthed Bob
rendered the dependence of the crew upon his presence
and enterprise, Sam thought, a matter of no
wonder. His stature was full six feet, and the great
breadth of his chest and shoulders, and extreme
length of his arms, terminated by hands of monstrous
size, gave demonstrations of unusual physical power.
The width of his mouth was the most striking feature
in his face, and had procured for him the common
nickname by which Jinks had first mentioned him
during the evening. The forbidding glance of his
large eyes, from under a low forehead, and brows as
shaggy as if they pertained to an ass's colt, with the
bull-dog shape of his head, at the sides, causing his
ears to stand forward after a form scarcely human,
were also peculiarities in the features of the captain-burglar.</p>

<p>His third basin being despatched by this powerful
animal, for such his peculiarity of frame seemed
to warrant his being termed, the conversation took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
turn for business. Robberies of a cheese warehouse,
a flour shop, a liquor vault, and even of the subterranean
workshop of a "smasher," or maker and vender
of false coin, were planned. The only debate was,
which was to be undertaken first; and as there was
some difficulty in settling this point, the captain
called for the jug to be replenished. Jinks descended
once more, but returned with only half the vessel
full, and, setting it down, declared the barrel below
was empty.</p>

<p>"Then that determines the point," observed Wide-mouthed
Bob: "we must make our way direct to the
brandy cellar."</p>

<p>The gang immediately assented,&mdash;the liquor was
shared; and in a few minutes, all, save Jinks, and
the woman, and the lad, descended by the stairs, and
departed on their lawless enterprise.</p>

<p>Sam Simkins had fallen asleep some time before the
departure of the gang, but was awaked by Jinks, as
soon as he had bolted the door and re-ascended the
steps, to receive his first wholesale lesson in villainy.
The lad felt the lesson very unwelcome to his nature,
at the beginning; but the remembrance of the
horrors from which he had escaped, and the promise
and prospect of a wild freedom, and a continuance
of the good fare he had met among the thieves, soon
subdued the inward whisper that he was going
wrong. Jinks and the woman were most successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
in their schooling of Sam, while they dwelt upon his
master's conduct towards him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But did the nigger-driver never let you play a
bit, Sam?" asked the woman: "you say you always
dropped work at eight, and went to bed at ten:&mdash;what
did ye in the two hours, my lad?"</p>

<p>"I used to read Jeremiah, and the rest of the
prophet-books in the Bible, and Romans, and Corinthians,
and them ere parts of the Testament," answered
Sam: "mester would na let me read owt else,
unless I managed to do it slily."</p>

<p>"And what did ye think to what you read, Sam?"
asked Jinks, suddenly dropping his pipe, and looking
at the lad with an air of new interest.</p>

<p>"He, he!" snivelled the lad, and twisted his
thumbs with a loutish look,&mdash;"I could na make owt
on 'em!"</p>

<p>"How the devil were ye likely?" said Jinks:
"that Paul would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer, for
he was a devilish long-headed fellow, and no mistake;
as for Jeremiah, and the rest of 'em, I know little
about 'em; but it was an ugly slavish way of using
you, my lad,&mdash;you'll find the difference now. All
that you have to do is to mind your P's and Q's,
and I'll warrant ye, it'll be a merry life for ye."</p>

<p>The lad snivelled again, and felt wonderfully
pleased.</p>

<p>"Now hark ye, Sam," continued Jinks, "who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
had your master in the house, besides himself and
you?"</p>

<p>"The missus," answered Sam; "but hur never
taks no notice o' nowt, hur's ower deeaf."</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed Jinks, cracking his thumb
and finger; and then the lad received instruction as
to his first grand act of villainy, and while he was receiving
it, Bess prepared the caldron, once more.</p>

<p>Three hours elapsed, and the whistle of Wide-mouthed
Bob was heard again. Jinks performed his
porter's office as before, and the captain and three
others of the gang speedily tugged up the stairs a
couple of kegs of liquor, which were as speedily
concealed in the subterranean room.</p>

<p>"Where's the rest o' the birds?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Sent 'em home to roost," replied the captain;
"and now you and all of us must cut, old girl, and
leave Jinks to his cage."</p>

<p>"But not before we've tasted the new broach,"
said the woman.</p>

<p>"No more tasting of it, this morning," answered
Bob; "we shall soon be blown, if we carry on that
game: we'll have breakfast and go."</p>

<p>The word of the leader was law. The stew was
again poured up; and when it was devoured, Sam
having his share as before, the chief burglar, and the
other three thieves, with the woman, departed; and
Sam Simkins also set out on the errand for which
Jinks had lately bestowed instruction upon him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>At eight the following morning, Mr. Jonas Straitlace
appeared in the twitchel, as before, and summoned
the attention of Jinks by a bold rap. Jinks
was speedily at the door, and Straitlace was again
admitted into the thievish head-quarters.</p>

<p>"Now for the chink!" said the broken-down
lawyer.</p>

<p>"But where's the lad?" asked Straitlace.</p>

<p>"The moment you down with the dust, that moment
I tell you where he is, safe and sound, and
nearer home than you think of; so that you'll have
very little trouble to seek him," answered Jinks.</p>

<p>"When I find the lad I'll pay you," said the saddler;
"you may be deceiving me."</p>

<p>"Why, d&mdash;n it!" said Jinks, "what d'ye take me
for?&mdash;let that sneaking fellow, who stands squeezed
up in the corner there below, be witness between us."</p>

<p>Straitlace turned pale; but Jinks was at the bottom
of the stair in a moment, and again ascended,
bringing up a man dressed in a thick top coat that
covered his under dress.</p>

<p>"Now, let this constable be witness between us,"
said Jinks: "he's a respectable man, and you could
not have brought a better man with you."</p>

<p>Straitlace was amazed;&mdash;but he summoned resolution,
and said, "Constable, I insist upon your
taking this man into custody, for having either decoyed
away from me, or concealed, or harboured, my
runaway 'prentice."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>The constable put on a very stupid look, and
answered,&mdash;"Why, as to that, I've no proof of any
part of it, you know, and I decline to interfere."</p>

<p>Straitlace felt confounded at the fact of his own
man, as he had deemed the constable, deserting him,
and stood staring in amazement.</p>

<p>"Now, Mister Jonas Straitlace," said Jinks, "I'd
have you to remember that I don't give professional
advice for nought, any more than other lawyers. You
came here to ask my help and instruction, and I engaged
to give it you for two sovereigns: pay me that
down, and I undertake that you shall find your apprentice
at home when you return."</p>

<p>The saddler felt enraged at the villain's impudence,
but the constable was against him:&mdash;"If you made
that bargain you had better keep it," said the functionary,
"and if this man breaks it, then I shall
be witness to it." And Straitlace felt he was so
awkwardly fixed in that suspicious place, and between
the two, that he gave Jinks the two sovereigns.
Had he kept a strict watch upon the motions of the
constable and Jinks he would have seen them share
the booty, ere they hurried down the stair.</p>

<p>Straitlace reached home, and found that Sam had
returned, but was again departed. His deaf wife
could only tell that she had scolded him, and made
him get to work in the shop without his breakfast;
but she did not know when he went off again. The
condition of the "till," in the shop, fully proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the way in which Sam had employed himself during
his brief stay. It had been forcibly wrested from its
place, though strongly fixed, and robbed of its contents,
which were not great, but were sufficient to
destroy, by their loss, the peace of Mr. Straitlace's
spiritual mind for many a day after.</p>

<p>Straitlace sat down to his work instead of going
again in search of Sam Simkins. Of what value
would a thief be to me? was one question he asked
himself; and&mdash;shall I spend in law, to prosecute him,
more money than I have thrown away already? was
another. A few days after, he met the constable in
Birmingham, and related his disaster. "You act
wisest to keep quiet," said the constable: "it seems
the man kept his word in sending the lad home,&mdash;so
that I don't see how you could have the law of
him, there; and as for the young scoundrel, he would
do you no good:&mdash;good-day, sir."</p>

<p>Straitlace did not know whether there was any
soundness in the man's observation about law; but
he was loath to spend more money or lose his time,&mdash;so
he gave Sam up.</p>

<p>The lad returned to Jinks's "hiding-hole," and
received great commendations for the clever way in
which he had used the "jemmy," or small steel crowbar,
which Jinks had entrusted to him. The robbery
of his master's till was his first performance with this
crack tool that old gaol-birds chirp so much of; but
it was not his last, by many a score. He progressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
in skill till he became the favourite comrade of Wide-mouthed
Bob, and the two were the terror of the

<p>It could serve no virtuous purpose to detail his
thieveries; and as for the character of the company
he kept, the sketch foregoing may suffice to show
what it was. He was, at length, sent over-sea for
life, in company with the leader and two others of
the gang; while Jinks escaped, only to decoy more
lads into vice, and train them for the hulks or the gallows;
but Mr. Jonas Straitlace, through the grinding
of his customers, lost them,&mdash;so that he took no more
apprentices to train up, in his own peculiar way, for
Jinks's second training and perfecting process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is, in appearance, an elegant volume, such a one as people
like to see on a drawing-room table; for there must be books for
show as well as for use, especially in the height of 'the season.'
The contents do not belie the promise of the exterior. We have a
number of prettily executed engravings, new and old, the subjects
as various as form the exhibition of the Royal Academy: on one
leaf a pageant of chivalry, by Stephanoff; on another a rural solitude,
by Creswick; on another a storm over a harvest-field, by
Westall; on others, a cottage girl by Gainsborough, portraits of
beauties by Uwins and Chalon, landscapes by Turner, and so on
to the concluding plate, from one of Collins's charming forest scenes,
with village children, whose very rags are picturesque, and whose
smiles are the ideal of rustic joy. Miss Toulmin has constructed a
pretty, feeling tale, which embraces all those subjects&mdash;a task an
author less ingenious might have given up in despair, but which she
has happily accomplished. The course of the story is varied by
romantic episodes and poetic legends. The object Miss Toulmin
proposed to herself she has effectively worked out, and connected
recollections of the romance of the past with a tale illustrative of the
incidents of the present."&mdash;<i>Britannia.</i></p>

<span class="vspace">&#8195;</span><br />
<i>This beautiful Volume is dedicated by Special Command to<br />

<p>The Rhine Book, by an arrangement entirely novel, seeks to separate
the Romance of Travel from its Commonplace. Numerous
Illustrations from original sketches, and all the attractions of the
finest printing, render the volume worthy of the library, the
drawing-room, or the boudoir, whilst it unites with its claims
to elegance those points of practical usefulness necessary in a
Guide Book. Dates, distances, times, and prices, are fully and exactly
stated, to enable the Tourist to know and regulate his expenses
at pleasure, and to avoid those extortions to which, when
destitute of such information, he would most certainly be subject.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Our perusal of the book enables us to say that it fully bears out
this description of its contents. The information necessary for the
comfort and convenience of the Tourist, down to the most minute
particulars, is exact and satisfactory; and the general reader will
find poetry, romance, and legendary lore sufficient to rouse his imagination
and gratify his curiosity, though he should never visit the
scenes to which they belong. The volume is richly embellished
with vignettes representing the most remarkable objects and most
picturesque features of scenery, executed with the beauty for which
Mr. How's illustrated publications are so highly distinguished."&mdash;<i>John
Bull.</i></p>

<p>"We can with truth recommend this volume as combining more
entertaining matter with a large quantity of really useful information
than we have hitherto seen in any work on the Rhine."&mdash;<i>Sunday

stalking, bison and bear shooting, are among the perilous exploits

<span class="vspace">&#8195;</span><br />
BY MR. AND MRS. S. C. HALL.</p>

<p>This work, being now complete, is recommended to all who desire
acqaintance with Ireland. In testimony of its impartiality, the Publisher
refers to the recorded opinions of the several leading Journals
of England and Scotland of all parties; more especially to those of
the two great political organs, after the volumes were brought to a
close:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Many books and pamphlets have been written, since the beginning
of the present century, in regard to the social, moral, and
physical condition of Ireland; but generally those works have resulted
from meditation in the closet rather than from actual observation
of the country and its inhabitants. Most of them, too, have
been composed for party purposes, or party objects; and, if we
except a few books of an historic character, and one or two others
limited to particular subjects, there was, till the appearance of the
volumes before us, hardly a single work, within our knowledge,
relating to Ireland, which we should be inclined to praise for its
moderation, accuracy, and impartiality. The book presents us with
a body of facts relating to the sister kingdom, which, being the
result of personal observation and investigation, ought at this moment
to command the attentive consideration of all who are interested in
its welfare and prosperity. Written in a spirit of great moderation,
although not entirely free from political bias, the work evinces
throughout a desire to exhibit things as they really are, and to
extend equal-handed justice to all parties and to all sects. The work
abounds with illustrations, which are beautifully executed, and the
sketches of national character with which it is interspersed will
afford ample amusement to those who would, without them, have
perhaps but little inclination to peruse the more valuable portions of
the work."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, October 12, 1843.</p>

<p>"The most popular work on the beauties and characteristics of
Ireland, as a whole, which has appeared for many years, has been
brought to a close. For its impartiality and truthfulness the two
editors have been more than once complimented by persons of
every party; and the same distinguishing features which marked the
early numbers have been preserved to the very close. Partisans
may differ from the conclusions at which Mr. and Mrs. Hall have
arrived, but no one will venture to say that either the lady or her
husband have misstated or misrepresented any thing."&mdash;<i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, Nov. 10.</p>

<p>"Next to Maria Edgeworth, there is no writer to whose pen
Ireland is more deeply indebted for the generous advocacy of its
claims, and graphic delineation of its living manners, by which the
sympathies of the reader are engaged on behalf of its long oppressed
population, than Mrs. Hall. No one more competent, as well as
willing, to do justice to Ireland, could have been selected for the
present task, than this very lively writer and her literary partner."&mdash;<i>The
Patriot.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
